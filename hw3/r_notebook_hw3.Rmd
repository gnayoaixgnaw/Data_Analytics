# count the key words

for ( i in 1:length(key_list$word)){
        keyword20 <- str_count(all_2020_6$category, key_list$word[i])
        count_20 <- sum(keyword20)
        keyword19 <- str_count(all_2019_6$category, key_list$word[i])

        keyword16 <- str_count(all_2016_6$category_name, key_list$word[i])
        count_16 <- sum(keyword16)
        
        word_list <- c(count_16, count_17, count_18, count_19, count_20)
        Years <- c(2016,2017,2018,2019,2020)

                xlab="Year",ylab="Frequency")
}

```
As we can see, all of the five years did not follow the Gaussian distribution.
```{r}
years <- c('2018', '2018', '2019', '2019', '2020', '2020')
Keywords <- c('Fashion & Wearables','Health & Fitness','Fashion & Wearables','Health & Fitness','Fashion & Wearables','Health & Fitness')
fw_count_18 <- sum(str_count(all_2018_6$category, 'Fashion & Wearables'))
hf_count_18 <- sum(str_count(all_2018_6$category, 'Health & Fitness'))
fw_count_19 <- sum(str_count(all_2019_6$category, 'Fashion & Wearables'))
hf_count_19 <- sum(str_count(all_2019_6$category, 'Health & Fitness'))
fw_count_20 <- sum(str_count(all_2020_6$category, 'Fashion & Wearables'))
hf_count_20 <- sum(str_count(all_2020_6$category, 'Health & Fitness'))
fw_count <-c(fw_count_18,fw_count_19,fw_count_20)
hf_count <- c(hf_count_18,hf_count_19,hf_count_20)

df_1 <- data.frame(fw_count,hf_count)

aovres = aov(fw_count~hf_count, data=df_1)
summary(aovres)

```
the pr(>F) of ANOVA Test is 0.00341, it is smaller than 0.05,this means we can reject hypotheses: The distributions of both samples are not equal.
```{r}
# KW-Test
list(fw_count,hf_count)
kruskal.test(list(fw_count,hf_count))
```
the p-value of KW Test is 0.5127, it is larger than 0.05,this means we can not reject hypotheses: The distributions of both samples are equal.
```{r}
# MW-Test
list(fw_count,hf_count)
wilcox.test(fw_count,hf_count)
```
the p-value of MW Test is 0.7, it is larger than 0.05,this means we can not reject hypotheses: The distributions of both samples are equal.
```{r}
#effect size
#install.packages("effsize")
library("effsize")

res_cohen = cohen.d(fw_count,hf_count,return.dm=TRUE)
print(res_cohen)

res_cliff = cliff.delta(fw_count,hf_count,return.dm=TRUE)
print(res_cliff)
```



```{r}
# Question3

#Pearson Coefficient
cor(fw_count,hf_count, method = "pearson")

#Spearman Coefficient

cor(fw_count,hf_count, method = "spearman")

#Kendall Coefficient√ü
cor(fw_count,hf_count, method = "kendall")
```
we can see that coefficient of Pearson is 0.99 and that of Spearman and Kendall are 1, so we can say that these two dataset are  correalated.


This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
