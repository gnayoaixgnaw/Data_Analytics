"2","[Brief Scale to assess Social Support in Chronic Diseases (SUCE-4)].","                 Label=""AIM OF THE STUDY"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"":Social support is an important resource for coping with serious chronic diseases such as cancer. The available questionnaires for the measurement of social support are usually extensive. So far, available short versions do not completely aim at situation-specific requirements of the social environment of chronically ill patients. Therefore, a short form of a measure of perceived social support was developed consisting of only 4 items: the SUCE-4.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A sample of cancer patients (N=424) was examined at 2 time points. The factor structure was evaluated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and reliability and validity were examined.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The expected factor structure was confirmed (for CFA: RMSEA=0.028). The short questionnaire revealed a good internal consistency (Cronbach's α&gt;0.86). In terms of the first indications of validity, significant and expected correlations with psychological quality of life, self-efficacy expectations, depression and anxiety were found at both time points.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":The SUCE-4 is an economical, reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of perceived social support in the context of severe chronic diseases such as cancer.             Label=""ZIEL DER STUDIE"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Soziale Unterstützung ist bei schweren chronischen Erkrankungen wie z. B. Krebs eine wichtige Ressource zur Krankheitsbewältigung. Die verfügbaren Fragebögen zur Erfassung der sozialen Unterstützung sind meist recht umfangreich. Bisher vorliegende Kurzformen zielen inhaltlich nicht vollständig auf die situationsspezifischen Anforderungen an das soziale Umfeld ab. Deshalb wurde eine Kurzform zur Messung der wahrgenommenen sozialen Unterstützung bestehend aus 4 Items entwickelt: der SUCE-4.             Label=""METHODEN"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Es wurde eine Stichprobe von Krebspatienten (N=424) zu 2 Messzeitpunkten betrachtet. Die Faktorenstruktur wurde mit einer explorativen und einer konfirmatorischen Faktorenanalyse (CFA) evaluiert und Reliabilität und Validität wurden geprüft.             Label=""ERGEBNISSE"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Die angenommene Faktorenstruktur wurde bestätigt (bei der CFA: RMSEA=0,028). Die Kurzform hatte eine gute interne Konsistenz (Cronbachs α&gt;0,86). Im Sinne erster Hinweise auf Validität fanden sich zu beiden Zeitpunkten signifikante erwartungskonforme Zusammenhänge mit psychischer Lebensqualität, Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung, Depressivität und Ängsten.             Label=""SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Der SUCE-4 ist ein ökonomisches, reliables und valides Instrument zur Erfassung wahrgenommener sozialer Unterstützung im Kontext schwerer chronischer Erkrankungen wie z. B.

Label=""SUMMARY ANSWER"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Daily administration of NAC for 7-12 days post-transplantation reduced ischemia-reperfusion injury and increased follicle survival in human ovarian xenografts by upregulating the antioxidant defense system and exerting anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects.                 Label=""WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Freezing of human ovarian tissue is performed with high follicular survival rates but up to 70% of follicles appear to be lost due to hypoxia and ischemia-reperfusion injury during ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT). NAC has been demonstrated to possess antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties, and studies in rodents have shown that intraperitoneal administration of NAC reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury and increases follicle survival in autotransplanted murine ovaries.                 Label=""STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Pieces of frozen-thawed human ovarian tissue from 28 women aged 23-36 years were transplanted to immunodeficient mice in short- and long-term xenograft studies or cultured in vitro. Three short-term xenograft studies (1-week duration) were performed, in which saline or 150 mg/kg NAC was administered for 7 days post-transplantation (n = 12 patients per group). Two long-term xenograft studies (4 weeks of duration) were performed. In one of these studies, saline or 150 mg/kg NAC was administered for 12 days (n = 12 patients per group), while in the other study 50, 150 or 300 mg/kg NAC was administered for 7 days (n = 8 patients per group). In addition, human ovarian tissue (n = 12 pieces from three patients per group) was cultured with increasing concentrations of NAC (0, 5, 25 and 75 mM) for 4 days in vitro.                 Label=""PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Donated ovarian tissue was obtained from women who had undergone ovarian tissue cryopreservation for fertility preservation at the University Hospital of Copenhagen. Cortical tissue pieces (5 × 5 × 1 mm) were transplanted subcutaneously to immunodeficient mice and NAC or saline was injected intraperitoneally. Grafts were retrieved after 1 or 4 weeks and follicle density was assessed. Gene expression analysis of antioxidant defense markers (superoxide dismutase; Sod1/SOD1, heme oxygenase-1; Hmox1/HMOX1, catalase; Cat/CAT), proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha; Tnf-α, interleukin-1-beta; Il1-β, interleukin 6; Il6), apoptotic factors (B-cell lymphoma 2; Bcl2/BCL2, Bcl-2-associated X protein; Bax/BAX) and angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor A; Vegfa/VEGFA, angiopoietin-like 4; Angptl4/ANGPTL4) was performed in 1-week-old human ovarian xenografts and in cultured human ovarian tissue. Grafts retrieved after 4 weeks were histologically processed and analyzed for vascularization by CD31 immunohistochemical staining, fibrosis by Masson's Trichrome staining and apoptosis by immunofluorescence using cleaved caspase-3.                 Label=""MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":After 1-week grafting, the relative expression of Sod1, Hmox1 and Cat was significantly higher in the group receiving 150 mg/kg NAC (NAC150-treated group) compared to controls (P = 0.04, P = 0.03, and P = 0.01, respectively), whereas the expression levels of Tnf-α, Il1-β and Il6 were reduced. The Bax/Bcl2 ratio was also significantly reduced in the NAC150-treated group (P &lt; 0.005). In vitro, the relative gene expression of SOD1, HMOX1 and CAT increased significantly in the human ovarian tissue with increasing concentrations of NAC (P &lt; 0.001 for all genes). However, the expression of VEGFA and ANGPTL4 as well as the BAX/BCL2 ratio decreased significantly with increasing concentrations of NAC (P &lt; 0.02, P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). After 4-week grafting, fibrosis measured by collagen content was similar in the NAC150-treated group compared to controls (control: 56.6% ± 2.2; NAC150: 57.6% ± 1.8), whereas a statistically significant reduction in the CD31-positive vessel area was found (control: 0.69% ± 0.08; NAC150: 0.51% ± 0.07; P &lt; 0.02). Furthermore, a reduced immunoreactivity of cleaved caspase-3 was observed in follicles of the NAC150-treated xenografts compared to controls. Follicle density (follicles/mm3, mean ± SD) was higher in the NAC150-treated group compared to the control group in the 1-week xenografts (control: 19.5 ± 26.3; NAC150: 34.2 ± 53.5) and 4-week xenografts (control: 9.3 ± 11.0; NAC150: 14.4 ± 15.0). Overall, a 2-fold increase in follicle density was observed in the NAC150-group after 1-week grafting where fold changes in follicle density were calculated in relation to grafts from the same patient. Around a 5-fold increase in follicle density was observed in the NAC150 and NAC300 groups after 4-week grafting.                 Label=""LARGE SCALE DATA"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":N/A.                 Label=""LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Follicle density in the human ovarian cortex is highly heterogeneous and can vary 100-fold between cortex pieces from the same woman. A high variability in follicle density within and between treatment groups and patients was found in the current study. Thus, solid conclusions cannot be made. While intraperitoneal injections of NAC appeared to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury in human ovarian xenografts, different administration routes should be investigated in order to optimize NAC for potential clinical use.                 Label=""WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":This is the first study to demonstrate the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties of NAC in xenotransplanted human ovarian tissue. Therefore, NAC appears to be a promising candidate for protecting ovarian follicles from ischemia-reperfusion injury. This provides the initial steps toward clinical application of NAC, which could potentially reduce the loss of ovarian follicles following OTT.

"4","Establishing patient-tailored variability-based paradigms for anti-cancer therapy: Using the inherent trajectories which underlie cancer for overcoming drug resistance.","Drug resistance is a major obstacle for successful therapy of many malignancies and is affecting the loss of response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Tumor-related compensatory adaptation mechanisms contribute to the development of drug resistance. Variability is inherent to biological systems and altered patterns of variability are associated with disease conditions. The marked intra and inter patient tumor heterogeneity, and the diverse mechanism contributing to drug resistance in different subjects, which may change over time even in the same patient, necessitate the development of personalized dynamic approaches for overcoming drug resistance. Altered dosing regimens, the potential role of chronotherapy, and drug holidays are effective in cancer therapy and immunotherapy. In the present review we describe the difficulty of overcoming drug resistance in a dynamic system and present the use of the inherent trajectories which underlie cancer development for building therapeutic regimens which can overcome resistance. The establishment of a platform wherein patient-tailored variability signatures are used for overcoming resistance for ensuing long term sustainable improved responses is presented."

They are virtually resistant to many DNA-damaging therapeutic approaches, such as chemo- and external beam therapy, which might be overcome by DNA damage inhibition induced by proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib.                 Label=""METHODS AND RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":In this study, we assessed several combined treatment modalities in vitro and in vivo. By cell-based functional analyses, in a 3D in ovo and an orthotopic mouse model, we demonstrated sensitizing effects of bortezomib combined with cisplatin, radiation and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). By gene expression profiling and western blot, we explored the underlying mechanisms, which resulted in an impaired DNA damage repair. Therapy-induced DNA damage triggered extrinsic proapoptotic signaling as well as the induction of cell cycle arrest, leading to a decreased vital tumor volume and altered tissue composition shown by magnetic resonance imaging and F-18-FDG-PET in vivo, however with no significant additional benefit related to PRRT alone.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":We demonstrated that bortezomib has short-term sensitizing effects when combined with DNA damaging therapy by interfering with DNA repair in vitro and in ovo. Nevertheless, due to high tumor heterogeneity after PRRT in long-term observations, we were not able to prove a therapeutic advantage of bortezomib-combined PRRT in an in vivo mouse model. "

However, the Se-induced epigenome in breast cancer cells was yet to be studied.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":The profiles of DNA methylation, microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and message RNA (mRNA) in breast cancer cells treated with sodium selenite were examined by microarrays. We verified the epigenetic modifications by integrating their predicted target genes and differentially expressed mRNAs. The epigenetically regulated genes were further validated in a breast cancer cohort by associating with tumor progression. We conducted a series of bioinformatics analyses to assess the biological function of these validated genes and identified the critical genes.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The Se-induced epigenome regulated the expression of 959 genes, and 349 of them were further validated in the breast cancer cohort. Biological function analyses suggested that these validated genes were enriched in several cancer-related pathways, such as PI3K/Akt and metabolic pathways. Based on the degrees of expression change, hazard ratio difference, and connectivity, NEDD4L and FMO5 were identified as the critical genes.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":These results confirmed the epigenetic effects of sodium selenite and revealed the epigenetic profiles in breast cancer cells, which would help understand the mechanisms of Se against breast cancer.

"7","Smoking and COVID-19: What we know so far.","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has placed a spotlight on infectious diseases and their associations with host factors and underlying conditions. New data on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus are entering the public domain at a rapid rate such that their distillation often lags behind. To minimise weak associations becoming perceived as established paradigms, it is imperative that methodologies and outputs from different studies are appropriately critiqued and compared. In this review, we examine recent data on a potential relationship between smoking and COVID-19. While the causal role of smoking has been firmly demonstrated in regard to lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such associations have the benefit of decades' worth of multi-centre epidemiological and mechanistic data. From our analysis of the available studies to date, it appears that a relationship is emerging in regard to patients with a smoking history having a higher likelihood of developing more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease than non-smokers. Data on whether COVID-19 has a greater incidence in smokers than non-smokers is thus far, contradictory and inconclusive. There is therefore a need for some caution to be exercised until further research has been conducted in a wider range of geographical settings with sufficient numbers of patients that have been carefully phenotyped in respect of smoking status and adequate statistical control for confounding factors."

In this study, we explored the function and molecular mechanism of lncRNA SPINT1-AS1 in breast cancer progression.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A total of 30 patients and 25 healthy controls were enrolled to detect the expression of SPINT1-AS1 in the serum by RT-qPCR. CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, EdU assay, Transwell assay, Flow cytometry for apoptosis assay and wound healing assays were used to explore the effects of SPINT1-AS1 on the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis were used to enrich the downstream target genes and related pathways of miRNAs interacting with SPINT1-AS1, construct a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network diagram.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":SPINT1-AS1 is up-regulated in the serum of breast cancer patients and breast cancer cell lines. The proliferation and migration ability of breast cancer cells were decreased significantly after SPINT1-AS1 knockdown, and it may inhibit its expression by sponging miR-let-7a/b/i-5p, thereby promoting breast cancer progression.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":SPINT1-AS1 can promote the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells by regulating miR-let-7a/b/i-5p, suggesting that it may be an important regulator of breast cancer progression.

"9","Survival prediction and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors: A prognostic immune signature for hepatocellular carcinoma.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers all over the world. Several studies have explored if immune-related genes and tumor immune microenvironment could play roles in HCC prognoses. This study is aimed at developing a prognostic signature of HCC based on immune-related genes or tumor immune microenvironment to predict survival and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We constructed a prognostic signature using bioinformatics method and validated its predictive capability. The mechanisms of the signature prediction were explored with The Cancer Immunome Atlas (TCIA) and mutation analysis. We also explored the association between the signature and immunophenoscore (IPS), which is the marker of ICIs response. A 6 immune-related-gene (6-IRG) signature was developed. It was revealed in a multivariate analysis that the 6-IRG signature was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival and progression-free interval among HCC patients. In the high-risk group of 6-IRG signature score, macrophage M0 cells and regulatory T cells, which are observed associated with poor overall survival in our study, were higher. The low-risk group had a higher IPS, which meant a better response to ICIs. Taken together, we constructed a reliable 6-IRG signature for prediction of survival and response to ICIs. The signature needs further testing for clinical application."

It is not yet possible to accurately predict the occurrence of BM. The purpose of the research is to develop and validate a prediction model of BM-free survival based on radiomics characterising the primary lesions combined with clinical characteristics in patients with curatively resected LA-NSCLC.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":This study consisted of 124 patients with curatively resected stage IIB-IIIB NSCLC in our institution between January 2014 and June 2018. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts using a 4:1 ratio. Radiomics features were selected from the chest CT images before surgery. A radiomics signature was constructed using the LASSO algorithm based on the training cohort. Clinical model was developed using the Cox proportional hazards model. The clinical, radiomics, and integrated nomograms were constructed. The prediction performance of the models was assessed based on its discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The radiomics signature is significantly associated with BM-free survival in the overall cohort. The discrimination performance of the integrated nomogram, with the C-indexes 0.889 (0.872-0.906, 95 % CI) and 0.853 (0.788-0.918, 95 % CI) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively, is significantly better than the clinical nomogram (p &lt; 0.0001 for the training cohort, p = 0.0008 for the validation cohort). Compared with the radiomics nomogram, the integrated nomogram is also improved to varying degrees, but not apparent in the validation cohort (p = 0.0007 for the training cohort, p = 0.0554 for the validation cohort). The calibration curve and decision curve analysis demonstrated that the integrated nomogram exceeded the clinical or radiomics nomograms in predicting BM-free survival.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Compared with the clinical or radiomics nomograms, the predictive performance of the integrated nomogram is significantly improved. The integrated nomogram is most suitable for predicting BM-free survival in patients with curatively resected LA-NSCLC. "
"13","Intermediate filaments as effectors of differentiation.","After the initial discovery of intermediate filament (IF)-forming proteins in 1968, a decade would elapse before they were revealed to comprise a diverse group of proteins which undergo tissue-, developmental stage-, differentiation-, and context-dependent regulation. Our appreciation for just how large (n = 70), conserved, complex, and dynamic IF genes and proteins are became even sharper upon completion of the human genome project. While there has been extraordinary progress in understanding the multimodal roles of IFs in cells and tissues, even revealing them as direct causative agents in a broad array of human genetic disorders, the link between individual IFs and cell differentiation has remained elusive. Here, we review evidence that demonstrates a role for IFs in lineage determination, cell differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. A major theme in this review is the function of IFs as sensors and transducers of mechanical forces, intersecting microenvironmental cues and fundamental processes through cellular redox balance."
"14","Artificial intelligence-based image classification methods for diagnosis of skin cancer: Challenges and opportunities.","Recently, there has been great interest in developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled computer-aided diagnostics solutions for the diagnosis of skin cancer. With the increasing incidence of skin cancers, low awareness among a growing population, and a lack of adequate clinical expertise and services, there is an immediate need for AI systems to assist clinicians in this domain. A large number of skin lesion datasets are available publicly, and researchers have developed AI solutions, particularly deep learning algorithms, to distinguish malignant skin lesions from benign lesions in different image modalities such as dermoscopic, clinical, and histopathology images. Despite the various claims of AI systems achieving higher accuracy than dermatologists in the classification of different skin lesions, these AI systems are still in the very early stages of clinical application in terms of being ready to aid clinicians in the diagnosis of skin cancers. In this review, we discuss advancements in the digital image-based AI solutions for the diagnosis of skin cancer, along with some challenges and future opportunities to improve these AI systems to support dermatologists and enhance their ability to diagnose skin cancer."
"15","Discovery of 4-amino-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin derivatives as novel discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) inhibitors.","DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by triple-helical collagens and has become an attractive target for anticancer therapy given its involvement in tumor growth, metastasis development, and tumor dormancy. Several drugs on the market, such as dasatinib and nilotinib, were reported to potently suppress the function of DDR1 and show significant therapeutic benefits in a variety of preclinical tumor models. Whereas only a few selective DDR1 inhibitors were disclosed in recent years. A series of 4-amino-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin derivatives were designed and synthesized. All compounds were evaluated via DDR1 kinase inhibition assay and cell anti-proliferative assay. One of the representative compounds, 6c, suppressed DDR1 kinase activity with an IC50 value of 44 nM and potently inhibited cell proliferation in DDR1-overexpressing cell lines HCT-116 and MDA-MB-231 with IC50 value of 4.00 and 3.36 μM respectively. Further molecular docking study revealed that 6c fitted ideally into DDR1 binding pocket and maintained the crucial hydrogen bonds with DDR1 kinase domain.

Age-standardized relative survival and relative excess risk of death (RER) were estimated by sex using period approach. RERs were adjusted for age, stage at diagnosis, cancer site, urbanity, hospital district and municipality by using Bayesian piecewise constant excess hazard models. Analyses were conducted including individual (basic, secondary, high) and area-based (quartiles Q1-Q4 based on the proportion of population with basic education) education separately as well as both measures in one model.

There was a clear gradient in 5-year relative survival across education groups (men: basic 62 %, secondary 64 %, high 69 %; women: basic 61 %, secondary 67 %, high 71 %). Compared to the basic education group, RER in the high education group was significantly lower. This association was still present after including area-based education in the models (men: RER 0.72, 95 % Confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.81; women: RER 0.76, 95 % CI 0.59-0.96). Area-based education revealed smaller effect estimates than individual education in CRC survival and no association for men.

The study's purpose was to describe the nature and key elements of therapeutic calls made by nurses to advanced cancer patients to understand what may have previously contributed to improvement in patients who received the intervention.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":As part of a larger study on methylphenidate and/or a nurse-telephone-intervention for fatigue in advanced cancer patients from a tertiary hospital, nurse calls were made to 95 patients. This qualitative descriptive study used thematic analysis of transcribed telephone calls between nurses and advanced cancer patients.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The overarching theme of these calls was supporting patients with empathy. Empathy in these conversations included nurses' efforts to understand patients' experiences, nurses communicating their understanding back to patients and nurses taking action in response to their understanding of patients' experiences. While humor and validation were used to communicate empathy, problem solving and providing support constituted the content of empathic communication.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":This study illustrates a nurse-telephone-interventions that embraced multiple components of clinical empathy. Nurse-telephone-interventions are feasible and acceptable with diverse, advanced cancer patients. The growing evidence base underscoring the numerous benefits of medical empathy may serve as a basis for adopting simple, feasible and accessible approaches such as empathic nurse-telephone-interventions in both research and clinical practice.

"19","A deep learning framework for quality assessment and restoration in video endoscopy.","Endoscopy is a routine imaging technique used for both diagnosis and minimally invasive surgical treatment. Artifacts such as motion blur, bubbles, specular reflections, floating objects and pixel saturation impede the visual interpretation and the automated analysis of endoscopy videos. Given the widespread use of endoscopy in different clinical applications, robust and reliable identification of such artifacts and the automated restoration of corrupted video frames is a fundamental medical imaging problem. Existing state-of-the-art methods only deal with the detection and restoration of selected artifacts. However, typically endoscopy videos contain numerous artifacts which motivates to establish a comprehensive solution. In this paper, a fully automatic framework is proposed that can: 1) detect and classify six different artifacts, 2) segment artifact instances that have indefinable shapes, 3) provide a quality score for each frame, and 4) restore partially corrupted frames. To detect and classify different artifacts, the proposed framework exploits fast, multi-scale and single stage convolution neural network detector. In addition, we use an encoder-decoder model for pixel-wise segmentation of irregular shaped artifacts. A quality score is introduced to assess video frame quality and to predict image restoration success. Generative adversarial networks with carefully chosen regularization and training strategies for discriminator-generator networks are finally used to restore corrupted frames. The detector yields the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 45.7 and 34.7, respectively for 25% and 50% IoU thresholds, and the lowest computational time of 88 ms allowing for near real-time processing. The restoration models for blind deblurring, saturation correction and inpainting demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods. On a set of 10 test videos, an average of 68.7% of video frames successfully passed the quality score (≥0.9) after applying the proposed restoration framework thereby retaining 25% more frames compared to the raw videos. The importance of artifacts detection and their restoration on improved robustness of image analysis methods is also demonstrated in this work."
"20","Cancer evolution: A means by which tumors evade treatment.","Although various methods have been tried to study and treat cancer, the cancer remains a major challenge for human medicine today. One important reason for this is the presence of cancer evolution. Cancer evolution is a process in which tumor cells adapt to the external environment, which can suppress the human immune system's ability to recognize and attack tumors, and also reduce the reproducibility of cancer research. Among them, heterogeneity of the tumor provides intrinsic motivation for this process. Recently, with the development of related technologies such as liquid biopsy, more and more knowledge about cancer evolution has been gained and interest in this topic has also increased. Therefore, starting from the causes of tumorigenesis, this paper introduces several tumorigenesis processes and pathways, as well as treatment options for different targets."

Despite pathogenic and clinical differences, both grades of serous ovarian carcinoma share the propensity to express receptors for the female hormones - oestrogen (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs) - albeit in differing frequencies.                 Label=""STUDY DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting the expression of hormone receptors in LGSOC, and comparison with expression in HGSOC.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Expression of ERs is observed in 80.7 % of patients with LGSOC [95 % confidence interval (CI) 72.2-89.1 %] and 61.5 % of patients with HGSOC (95 % CI 38.8-84.1 %). Expression of PRs is observed in 54.4 % of patients with LGSOC (95 % CI 44.3-64.4 %) and 30.7 % of patients with HGSOC (95 % CI 15.7-45.7 %).                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":A higher percentage of LGSOCs are positive for ER expression compared with HGSOCs. Similarly, a higher percentage of LGSOCs are positive for PR expression, although PR expression is lower than ER expression. Expression of hormone receptors may represent a therapeutic opportunity for treatment with agents that block their activity, especially in LGSOC which is less responsive to chemotherapy and therapeutic options are limited.

"23","Prediction of CD28-CD86 protein complex structure using different level of resolution approach.","Immune system plays essential role in functioning of higher organisms. Its hyperactivity can lead to autoimmune diseases or even anaphylactic shock while hypoactivity leads to proneness to infections or even cancer. T-cells play crucial role in immunity mechanisms and their activation and inhibition is strictly controlled by the regulatory proteins, such as CD28 and CTLA-4. Activity of these proteins is controlled by a pair of ligands, named CD80 and CD86, which can non-covalently bound to their receptors. While structure of human CTLA-4-CD86 complex in known, there is still no available structure for the CD28-CD86 system. To obtain the reliable structure of CD28-CD86 complex we first validated our methodology on the CTLA-4-CD86 system. Then coarse-grained UNRES-dock molecular docking simulation was performed followed by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, we obtained a complete CD28-CD86 complex structure on atomistic level, in which interaction interface is consistent with available data. We also determined the kinetic properties for CTLA4-CD86 and CD28-CD86 complexes with use of coarse-grained model and determined the key residues for complex formation with use of Robetta, PPCheck and HawkDock servers. Our results not only verify high accuracy of the UNRES-dock method, but also provide a highly reliable model of the CD28-CD86 complex, which can be used in further studies and drug design."

The current study aims to quantify the RBE (relative biologic effectiveness) variations of emitted X-rays from the surface of different spherical applicators and bare probe through a hybrid Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A validated MC model of INTRABEAM machine and different applicator diameters, based on GEANT4 Toolkit, was employed for RBE evaluation. To doing so, scored X-ray energy spectra at the surface of each applicator diameter/bare probe were used to calculate the corresponding secondary electron energy spectra at various distances inside the water and breast tissue. Then, MCDS (Monte Carlo damage simulation) code was used to calculate the RBE values according to the calculated electron spectra.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Presence of spherical applicators can increase the RBE of emitted X-rays from the bare probe by about 22.3%. In return, changing the applicator diameter has a minimal impact (about 3.2%) on RBE variation of emitted X-rays from each applicator surface. By increasing the distance from applicator surface, the RBE increments too, so that its value enhances by about 10% with moving from 2 to 10 mm distance. Calculated RBE values within the breast tissue were higher than those of water by about 4% maximum value.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Ball section of spherical IORT applicators can affect the RBE value of the emitted X-rays from INTRABEAM machine. Increased RBE of breast tissue can reduce the prescribed dose for breast irradiation if INTRABEAM machine has been calibrated inside the water. "

"26","Four-dimensional carbon-ion pencil beam treatment planning comparison between robust optimization and range-adapted internal target volume for respiratory-gated liver and lung treatment.","We investigated the dose differences between robust optimization-based treatment planning (4DRO) and range-adapted internal target volume (rITV). We used 4DCT dataset of 20 lung cancer and 20 liver cancer patients, respectively, who had been treated with respiratory-gated carbon-ion pencil beam scanning therapy. 4DRO and rITV plans were created with the same clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk (OAR) contours. Four-dimensional dose distribution was calculated using deformable image registration. Dose metrics (e.g. D95, V20) were analyzed. Statistical significance was assessed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For the lung cases, the mean CTV-D95 value for the rITV plan (=98.5%) was same as that for the 4DRO plan (=98.5%, P = 0.106), while the mean D95 value for the CTV + setup margin contour for the rITV plan (=98.2%) was higher than that for the 4DRO plan (95.2%, P &lt; 0.001). For the liver cases, the mean CTV-D95 value for the rITV plan (=98.1%) was slightly lower than that for the 4DRO plan (=98.5%, P &lt; 0.01), while the mean D95 value for the CTV + setup margin contour for the rITV plan (=98.0%) was higher than that for the 4DRO plan (94.1%, P &lt; 0.001). For the doses to the organs at risk (OARs), the ipsilateral lung-V20/liver-V20 values for the rITV plan (=10.1%/19.7%) was significantly higher than that for the 4DRO plan (=8.6%/17.6, P &lt; 0.001). Although the target coverage for 4DRO plan may be worse than that for rITV plan in the presence of the setup error, the 4DRO plan can improve OAR dose while preserving acceptable target dose coverage."
"27","The first parent-child diagnosis of a multifocal squamous odontogenic tumor: A case report.","Squamous odontogenic tumors (SOT) are rare, benign, odontogenic neoplasms of the jaws. The sporadically reported cases with multifocal SOTs seem to have a marked predilection for younger African American patients. In this case report a 14-year-old Caucasian male presented with swelling of the vestibular alveolar process, slight tooth divergence, and mobility. A multifocal squamous odontogenic tumor was diagnosed and subsequently treated twice with surgical enucleation. Two and a half years earlier his mother was diagnosed and treated for a similar multifocal SOT. Next-Generation-Sequencing targeted resequencing mutational analysis of the maternal surgical specimens was performed. No potential causal mutation could be identified. Postoperative follow-up of the patient showed no recurrence of the SOT after 2 years. This case report substantiates the possibility of a familial relationship in (multifocal) SOT, possibly changing current ideas concerning the etiology and treatment of these neoplasms."
"28","The role of ERα36 in cell type-specific functions of estrogen and cancer development.","Exploring the regulatory effects of estrogen on different body organs via its receptors is largely of interest. Recently, the expression, signaling and the clinical significance of ERα36, the newly identified isoform of ERα, mediating non-genomic signaling of estrogen, have been studied in a wide range of organs and tumors. ERα36 is expressed highly in the CNS and actively involved in neuroprotection. It is also suggested to be an important estrogen receptor involved in preserving bone in postmenopausal women. On the oncological side, although ERα36 has usually been considered to be an oncogenic molecule, results from some studies paradoxically imply its protective role in certain tumors. Collectively, it seems that ERα36 is highly involved in cell type-specific functions of estrogen through its MAPK/ERK signaling, which is dependent on ERα36 expression levels, ligand concentrations and disease stage. The response is also dependent on the levels of ERα66 and ERβ. These factors influence the ERK kinetic and determine the ultimate mitogenic or antimitogenic signaling of estrogen, leading to cell survival or cell death. In this review, we summarize the recent organ-specific, cellular and molecular events and the mechanisms involved in estrogen effects mediated through the ERα36/ ERα66 with a particular focus on carcinomas where more clinical information has recently emerged."
"29","Cannabis and its Constituents for Cancer: History, Biogenesis, Chemistry and Pharmacological Activities.","Cannabis has long been used for healing and recreation in several regions of the world. Over 400 bioactive constituents, including more than 100 phytocannabinoids, have been isolated from this plant. The non-psychoactive cannabidiol (CBD) and the psychoactive Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) are the major and widely studied constituents from this plant. Cannabinoids exert their effects through the endocannabinoid system (ECS) that comprises cannabinoid receptors (CB1, CB2), endogenous ligands, and metabolizing enzymes. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of cannabinoids against leukemia, lymphoma, glioblastoma, and cancers of the breast, colorectum, pancreas, cervix and prostate. Cannabis and its constituents can modulate multiple cancer related pathways such as PKB, AMPK, CAMKK-β, mTOR, PDHK, HIF-1α, and PPAR-γ. Cannabinoids can block cell growth, progression of cell cycle and induce apoptosis selectively in tumour cells. Cannabinoids can also enhance the efficacy of cancer therapeutics. These compounds have been used for the management of anorexia, queasiness, and pain in cancer patients. Cannabinoid based products such as dronabinol, nabilone, nabiximols, and epidyolex are now approved for medical use in cancer patients. Cannabinoids are reported to produce a favourable safety profile. However, psychoactive properties and poor bioavailability limit the use of some cannabinoids. The Academic Institutions across the globe are offering training courses on cannabis. How cannabis and its constituents exert anticancer activities is discussed in this article. We also discuss areas that require attention and more extensive research."

However, its delayed-intensification (DI) phase, comprising repeated blocks of protocol III (2003-PIII), was toxic and caused significant treatment delays. The successor MS2010 study attempted to lower DI toxicity by replacing myelosuppressive drugs (doxorubicin, cytarabine) with vincristine and asparaginase.

Similarly in 2010-PIIIb and PVb, where one block of cytarabine was replaced by two doses of vincristine, admissions for fever were also fewer (0.47 versus 0.74 A/blk, p &lt; 0.001) than in 2003-PIIIb. However, the addition of single doses of vincristine and asparaginase in 2010-PIIIa, even with a mandatory seven-day rest, led to more hospitalisations (0.45 A/blk, p &lt; 0.001), increased risk of bacteraemia (relative-risk (RR) = 7.66, p = 0.005) and critical-care admissions (RR = 4.31, p = 0.13). Despite this, overall treatment-related mortality decreased from 2.7% to 0.8%. Taken together, the reduced phase delays allowed earlier completion of the intensive phase of treatment (standard risk: 38.1 versus 49.4 weeks, p &lt; 0.001; intermediate risk: 50.9 versus 58.8 weeks, p &lt; 0.001), while maintaining excellent 10-year event-free survival of 95.4% and overall survival of 96.2%.

"31","Regulation and role of Acyl-CoA synthetase 4 in glial cells.","Acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (Acsl4), an enzyme involved in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, participates in physiological and pathological processes such as steroidogenesis and cancer. The role of Acsl4 in neurons and in nervous system development has also been documented but little is known regarding its functionality in glial cells. In turn, several processes in glial cells, including neurosteroidogenesis, stellation and AA uptake, are regulated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signal. In this context, the aim of this work was to analyze the expression and functional role of Acsl4 in primary rat astrocyte cultures and in the C6 glioma cell line by chemical inhibition and stable silencing, respectively. Results show that Acsl4 expression was regulated by cAMP in both models and that cAMP stimulation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein mRNA levels was reduced by Acsl4 inhibition or silencing. Also, Acsl4 inhibition reduced progesterone synthesis stimulated by cAMP and also affected cAMP-induced astrocyte stellation, decreasing process elongation and increasing branching complexity. Similar effects were observed for Acsl4 silencing on cAMP-induced C6 cell morphological shift. Moreover, Acsl4 inhibition and silencing reduced proliferation and migration of both cell types. Acsl4 silencing in C6 cells reduced the capacity for colony proliferation and neurosphere formation, the latter ability also being abolished by Acsl4 inhibition. In sum, this work presents novel evidence of Acsl4 involvement in neurosteroidogenesis and the morphological changes of glial cells promoted by cAMP. Furthermore, Acsl4 participates in migration and proliferation, also affecting cell self-renewal. Altogether, these findings provide insights into Acsl4 functions in glial cells."

"34","Three bufadienolides induce cell death in the human lung cancer cell line CL1-5 mainly through autophagy.","The effects of 3 bufadienolides, namely kalantuboside B, kalantuboside A, and bryotoxin C, isolated from Kalanchoe tubiflora (Harvey) were evaluated and characterized in CL1-5 highly metastatic human lung cancer cells. In contrast to their apoptosis-promoting activity in other cancer cells, these bufadienolides only slight or did not induce apoptosis in CL1-5 cancer cells. Instead, they activated an autophagy pathway, as indicated by increased autophagosome formation. Autophagy induced by these bufadienolides was demonstrated to be linked to the down-regulation of p-mTOR and the up-regulation of LC3-II, ATG5, ATG7, and Beclin-1. Our findings revealed an autophagy as the alternative mechanism of drug action by bufadienolides in CL1-5 lung cancer cells and provided evidence that bufadienolides are a potential therapeutic strategy for highly metastatic human lung cancer."

"36","Sample size re-estimation in adaptive enrichment design.","Clinical trial participants are often heterogeneous, which is a fundamental problem in the rapidly developing field of precision medicine. Participants heterogeneity causes considerable difficulty in the current phase III trial designs. Adaptive enrichment designs provide a flexible and intuitive solution. At the interim analysis, we enrich the subgroup of trial participants who have a higher likelihood to benefit from the new treatment. However, it is critical to control the level of the test size and maintain adequate power after enrichment of certain subgroup of participants. We develop two adaptive enrichment strategies with sample size re-estimation and verify their feasibility and practicability through extensive simulations and sensitivity analyses. The simulation studies show that the proposed methods can control the overall type I error rate and exhibit competitive improvement in terms of statistical power and expected sample size. The proposed designs are exemplified with a real trial application."
"37","Anaerobic bacterial communities associated with oral carcinoma: Intratumoral, surface-biofilm and salivary microbiota.","It was estimated that more than 700 bacterial species inhabit the oral cavity of healthy humans. Anaerobes comprise a significant fraction of the oral bacteriome and play an important role in the formation of multi-species biofilms attached to various anatomical sites. Bacterial biofilms are also associated with pathologic laesions of the oral cavity, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and distinct oral taxa could also be detected within the tumors, i.e. in deep biopsy samples. These observations suggested that certain oral bacteria or oral bacterial communities may play a causative role in oral carcinogenesis, in addition to the well characterized risk factors of oral cancer. Alternatively, it was also proposed that a subset of oral bacteria may have a growth advantage in the unique microenvironment of OSCC. Recently, a series of studies analysed the OSCC-associated bacterial communities using metataxonomic, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches. This review outlines the major differences between the community structure of microbiota in tumor biopsy, surface-biofilm and salivary or oral wash samples collected from OSCC patients, compared to corresponding samples from control persons. A special emphasis is given to the anaerobic bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium periodonticum that were characterised repeatedly as &quot;OSCC-associated&quot; in independent studies. Predicted microbial functions and relevant in vivo experimental models of oral carcinogenesis will also be summarized."

PanNENs comprise two subtypes with different clinical manifestations and molecular mechanisms: functional PanNENs and nonfunctional PanNENs. Excessive hormones and tumor progression severely affect the quality of life of patients or are even life threatening. However, the molecular mechanisms of hormone secretion and tumor progression in PanNENs have not yet been fully elucidated. At present, advancements in sequencing technologies have led to the exploration of new biological markers and an advanced understanding of molecular mechanisms in PanNENs. Multiomics sequencing could reveal differences and similarities in molecular features in different fields. However, sequencing studies of PanNENs are booming and should be summarized to integrate the current findings. In this review, we summarize the current status of multiomics sequencing in PanNENs to further guide its application. We explore mainly advancements in the genome, transcriptome, and DNA methylation fields. In addition, the cell origin of PanNENs, which has been a hot issue in sequencing research, is described in multiple fields."
"39","Sox9/INHBB axis-mediated crosstalk between the hepatoma and hepatic stellate cells promotes the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.","The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and liver fibrosis in the peri-tumoral tissue contributes to the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between hepatoma and peri-tumoral HSCs remain elusive. We found that the Sox9/INHBB axis is upregulated in HCC and is associated with tumor metastasis. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we revealed that the Sox9/INHBB axis promotes the growth and metastasis of an orthotopic HCC tumor by activating the peri-tumoral HSCs. Mechanistically, Sox9 induces INHBB expression by directly binding to its enhancer, thus aiding in the secretion of activin B from hepatoma cells, and in turn, promoting the activation of the surrounding HSCs through activin B/Smad signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of activin B/Smad singaling attenuates the fibrotic response in the peri-tumoral tissue and decreases the incidence of metastasis. Finally, clinical analyses indicated a positive correlation between Sox9 and INHBB expression in HCC specimens and identified the Sox9/INHBB axis as a positive regulator of liver fibrosis. In conclusion, Sox9/INHBB axis-mediated crosstalk between hepatoma cells and HSCs induces a fertile environment favoring HCC metastasis, thereby exhibiting as a potential therapeutic target."
"40","Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in cancer and cancer therapeutics.","Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, is a critical regulator in tumor metabolism. PKM2 has been demonstrated to overexpressed in various cancers and promoted proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. The errant expression of PKM2 has inspired people to investigate the function of PKM2 and the therapeutic potential in cancer. In addition, some studies have shown that the upregulation of PKM2 in tumor tissues is associated with the altered expression of lncRNAs and the poor survival. Therefore, researchers have begun to unravel the specific molecular mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated PKM2 expression in cancer metabolism. As the tumor microenvironment (TME) is essential in tumor development, it is necessary to identify the role of PKM2 in TME. In this review, we will introduce the role of PKM2 in different cancers as well as TME, and summarize the molecular mechanism of PKM2-related lncRNAs in cancer metabolism. We expect that this work will lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PKM2 that may help in developing therapeutic strategies in clinic for researchers."

We aimed to determine the global prevalence of Blastocystosis infection in people with immunodeficiency. A systematic literature search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus, Google scholar, Science Direct and MEDLINE databases to select all observational studies reporting the prevalence of Blastocystosis infection in Worldwide, based on different diagnostic methods in immunocompromised patients of any age and published from inception to February 2019. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using random effects models and in addition, the I2 statistic was calculated. The geographic distribution of studies was evaluated and the diagnosis of Blastocystis was compared by various techniques. Electronic databases were reviewed for Blastocystosis infection in HIV/AIDS, cancer and other immunocompromised patients, and meta-analyses were conducted to calculate the overall estimated prevalence. Total68 eligible studies were included. The estimated pooled prevalence rate of Blastocystosis infection in immunocompromised patients was overall 10% (95% CI, 7-13%; I2 96.04%) (P &lt; 0.001), of whom 21% [18-25] were in Australia, 12% [4-24] in America, 11% [6-17] in Europe and 10% [5-15], 7% [3-13] in Asia and Africa, respectively. It was calculated that the estimated pooled prevalence rate of Blastocystosis infection in immunocompromised patients was overall 10% and the prevalence estimates ranged from 0.44 to 72.39. Also, overall the prevalence of parasites co-infection in immunocompromised patients was detected as 0.024%. Our finding showed that immunocompromised people show a high prevalence of Blastocystosis infection compared to the control population. Adequate information on the prevalence rate is still missing from many countries. However, current information underscore that Blastocystis should not be neglected. "
"42","Genetic variant of RXR involved in the vitamin D metabolic pathway was linked to HCV infection outcomes among a high-risk Chinese population.","Genetic variation of related genes in Vitamin D (VD) metabolic pathway played an important role in antiviral immune response and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Retinoid X receptor (RXR) is one of the key genes in the metabolism pathway of VD. This study aims to investigate the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RXR on the outcomes of HCV infection. Three SNPs (RXRɑ-rs4842194, rs1045570 and RXRβ-rs2076310) were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY platform in 515 spontaneous clearance subjects, 830 persistent infection subjects, and 1062 uninfected subjects. Multivariate stepwise regression analyses was used to identify the prediction factors for HCV infection outcomes. The USCS Brower and RNAfold web serves were performed to further explore the potential biological functions of positive SNPs. The results of logistic regression analysis after adjusting for age, gender and types of high-risk population showed that subjects with RXRβ rs2076310-T (recessive model: adjusted OR = 1.598, 95%CI = 1.126-2.267, P = 0.009; additive model: adjusted OR = 1.196, 95%CI = 1.011-1.416, P = 0.037) had a significantly increased possibility of HCV infection chronicity. Rs2076310, age, types of high-risk population and aspartate aminotransferase were independent predictors of chronic HCV infection (P &lt; 0.05). And the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of combined effects of these factors was 0.679. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that rs2076310 could affect the gene expression level by affecting the transcriptional regulatory activity of the corresponding gene region. These findings indicated that genetic variation of RXRβ was associated with the risk of HCV infection chronicity among a high-risk Chinese population."
"43","Minimal residual disease monitoring using a 3'ALK universal probe assay in ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma: ddPCR, an attractive alternative method to real-time quantitative PCR.","In ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas, positive qualitative PCR for NPM1-ALK in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow at diagnosis and during treatment are associated with a higher risk of treatment failure. Real-time quantitative PCR allows identification of very high risk patients. However, this latter technique initially designed for patients with lymphomas carrying the most frequent NPM1-ALK translocation necessitates calibration curves, limiting inter-laboratory reproducibility. We designed an ALK universal quantitative PCR based on 3'ALK transcript amplification to allow the detection of all ALK fusion transcripts. We validate the absolute concordance of 3'ALK quantitative PCR results with the routine NPM1-ALK qualitative and quantitative PCR on 46 samples. The universality of ALK fusion transcript detection was also validated on TPM3-, ALO17- and ATIC-ALK-positive samples, and EML4-ALK-positive cell line. Then, we show that digital droplet PCR using 3'ALK universal probe gives highly concordant results with 3'ALK universal quantitative PCR. A major benefit of digital droplet PCR is a reduced experimental set-up compared with quantitative PCR, without generation of standard curves, leading to a reliable protocol for multilaboratory validation, in multicenter clinical trials essential for this rare pathology. Our ALK universal method could be used for the screening of ALK fusion transcripts in liquid biopsy of other ALK positive tumors, including non-small cell lung carcinomas."
"44","Two Questions about the Design of Cluster Randomized Trials: A Tutorial.","This is a short tutorial on two key questions that pertain to cluster randomized trials (CRTs): (1) Should I perform a CRT? and (2) If so, how do I derive the sample size? In summary, a CRT is the best option when you &quot;must&quot; (e.g., the intervention can only be administered to a group) or you &quot;should&quot; (e.g., because of issues such as feasibility and contamination). CRTs are less statistically efficient and usually more logistically complex than individually randomized trials, and so reviewing the rationale for their use is critical. The most straightforward approach to the sample size calculation is to first perform the calculation as if the design were randomized at the level of the patient, and then to inflate this sample size by multiplying by the &quot;design effect&quot;, which quantifies the degree to which responses within a cluster are similar to one another. Although trials with large numbers of small clusters are more statistically efficient than those with a few large clusters, trials with large clusters can be more feasible. Also, if results are to be compared across individual sites, then sufficient sample size will be required to attain adequate precision within each site. Sample size calculations should include sensitivity analyses, as inputs from the literature can lack precision. Collaborating with a statistician is essential. To illustrate these points, we describe an ongoing CRT testing a mobile-based app to systematically engage families of intensive care unit patients and help intensive care unit clinicians deliver needs-targeted palliative care."
"45","Development of a Novel Communication Liaison Program to Support COVID-19 Patients and their Families.","In the Spring of 2020, our hospital faced a surge of critically ill COVID-19 patients, with intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy peaking at 204% of the baseline maximum capacity. In anticipation of this surge, we developed a Remote Communication Liaison Program (RCLP) to help the ICU and palliative care teams support families of critically ill patients. In just nine days from inception until implementation, we recruited and prepared ambulatory specialty providers to serve in this role effectively, despite minimal prior critical care experience. We report here the primary elements needed to reproduce and scale this program in other hospitals facing similar ICU surges, including a checklist for replication (Appendix A). Keys to success include strong logistical support, clinical reference material designed for rapid evolution, and a liaison team structure with peer coaching."
"46","Novel regulator role of CIL-102 in the epigenetic modification of TNFR1/TRAIL to induce cell apoptosis in human gastric cancer.","CIL-102 (1-[4-(furo[2,3-b]quinolin-4-ylamino)phenyl]ethanone) is a major active agent and an alkaloid derivative of Camptotheca acuminata, which has valuable biological properties, including anti-tumorigenic activity. However, the molecular mechanisms of CIL-102 related to inductive apoptosis in human gastric cancer remain unclear. By using diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), annexin-V-fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide staining and a 2',7' -dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA), a Fluo-3 fluorescence staining assay, the cell death and cell viability in gastric cancer cells and an in vivo xenograft mouse model, with or without the addition of CIL-102, were measured, respectively. Furthermore, signaling pathways and apoptotic molecules were also detected by western blots and an immunohistochemical assay. Our results demonstrated that CIL-102 treatment significantly induced the cell apoptosis of gastric cancer cells, along with increased ROS production and increased intracellular Ca2+ levels. In addition, through the inactivation of CDK1/cyclin B1, CIL-102 treatment induced the cell cycle G2/M arrest of gastric cancer cells. Moreover, our data revealed that multiple signaling pathways were involved in the H3K4 trimethylation of TNFR1 and TRAIL proteins by CIL-102, including ROS-derived and JNK/mTOR/p300 pathways in gastric cancer AGS cells. The CIL-102 treatment also consistently inhibited tumor growth and increased tumor apoptosis, as measured by TUNEL assay in an in vivo xenograft mouse model. An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the upregulation of the TNFR1 and TRAIL proteins and the downregulation of PCNA and CDK1 proteins were found in the CIL-102-treated gastric cancer xenograft mouse model, compared to that of the saline control. Together, this study sheds light on the novel mechanism associated with CIL-102 for inducing gastric cancer apoptosis."

Overall survival results did not cross the prespecified efficacy boundary. Median OS (95% CI) in patients with lung and/or liver metastases was 37.2 months (28.7-43.6) and 22.8 months (19.0-26.8) in the alpelisib-fulvestrant and placebo-fulvestrant arms, respectively (HR=0.68 [0.46-1.00]). Median times to chemotherapy (95% CI) for the alpelisib-fulvestrant and placebo-fulvestrant arms were 23.3 months (15.2-28.4) and 14.8 months (10.5-22.6), respectively (HR=0.72 [0.54-0.95]). No new safety signals were observed with longer follow-up.

Given the rapid rise of studies uncovering novel insights and therapeutic opportunities based on the role of mitochondria in tumor metabolic programing and therapeutics, this review summarizes most significant developments in the field. Taking in mind the key role of mitochondria on carcinogenesis and tumor progression due to their involvement on tumor plasticity, metabolic remodeling, and signaling re-wiring, those organelles are also potential therapeutic targets. Among other topics, we address the recent data intersecting mitochondria as of prognostic value and staging in cancer, by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) determination, and current inhibitors developments targeting mtDNA, OXPHOS machinery and metabolic pathways. We contribute for a holistic view of the role of mitochondria metabolism and directed therapeutics to understand tumor metabolism, to circumvent therapy resistance, and to control tumor development."
"51","Capping protein regulator and myosin 1 linker 3 regulates transcription of key cytokines in activated phagocytic cells.","We have recently reported that capping protein regulator and myosin 1 linker 3 (CARMIL3), first identified as an oncofetal-like gene, is required for metastasis of breast and prostate cancer cells via regulating the actin cytoskeletal dynamics near the plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of CARMIL3 as an essential regulator of the transcription of several key proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages engulfing apoptotic cells and/or exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). CARMIL3-deficient macrophages expressed strongly abrogated levels of interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-23 in response to LPS, whereas IL-10 expression was enhanced. An RNA-seq analysis of CARMIL3-deficient and wild-type (WT) RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS revealed many differentially expressed genes, impacting several important inflammatory pathways. At the molecular level, CARMIL3 deficiency caused a strong impairment in LPS-activated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling with decreased IKKα/β and IκBα phosphorylation and severely reduced p65 protein levels. This study uncovers a crucial role of CARMIL3 in impacting the balance between inflammation and tissue homeostasis via regulating major cytokines production in phagocytic cells."
"52","Assay design and development strategies for finding Hsp90 inhibitors and their role in human diseases.","Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that facilitates the maturation of its client proteins including protein kinases, transcription factors, and steroid hormone receptors which are structurally and functionally diverse. These client proteins are involved in various cellular signaling pathways, and Hsp90 is implicated in various human diseases including cancer, inflammation, and diseases associated with protein misfolding; thus making Hsp90 a promising target for drug discovery. Some of its client proteins are well-known cancer targets. Instead of targeting these client proteins individually, however, targeting Hsp90 is more practical for cancer drug development. Efforts have been invested in recognizing potential drugs for clinical use that inhibit Hsp90 activity and result in the prevention of Hsp90 client maturation and dampening of subsequent signaling cascades. Here, we discuss current assays and technologies used to find and characterize Hsp90 inhibitors that include biophysical, biochemical, cell-based assays and computational modeling. This review highlights recent discoveries that N-terminal isoform-selective compounds and inhibitors that target the Hsp90 C-terminus that may offer the potential to overcome some of the detriments observed with pan Hsp90 inhibitors. The tools and assays summarized in this review should be used to develop Hsp90-targeting drugs with high specificity, potency, and drug-like properties that may prove immensely useful in the clinic."
"53","Sirtuins' control of autophagy and mitophagy in cancer.","Mammalian cells use a specialized and complex machinery for the removal of altered proteins or dysfunctional organelles. Such machinery is part of a mechanism called autophagy. Moreover, when autophagy is specifically employed for the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria, it is called mitophagy. Autophagy and mitophagy have important physiological implications and roles associated with cellular differentiation, resistance to stresses such as starvation, metabolic control and adaptation to the changing microenvironment. Unfortunately, transformed cancer cells often exploit autophagy and mitophagy for sustaining their metabolic reprogramming and growth to a point that autophagy and mitophagy are recognized as promising targets for ongoing and future antitumoral therapies. Sirtuins are NAD+ dependent deacylases with a fundamental role in sensing and modulating cellular response to external stresses such as nutrients availability and therefore involved in aging, oxidative stress control, inflammation, differentiation and cancer. It is clear, therefore, that autophagy, mitophagy and sirtuins share many common aspects to a point that, recently, sirtuins have been linked to the control of autophagy and mitophagy. In the context of cancer, such a control is obtained by modulating transcription of autophagy and mitophagy genes, by post translational modification of proteins belonging to the autophagy and mitophagy machinery, by controlling ROS production or major metabolic pathways such as Krebs cycle or glutamine metabolism. The present review details current knowledge on the role of sirtuins, autophagy and mitophagy in cancer to then proceed to discuss how sirtuins can control autophagy and mitophagy in cancer cells. Finally, we discuss sirtuins role in the context of tumor progression and metastasis indicating glutamine metabolism as an example of how a concerted activation and/or inhibition of sirtuins in cancer cells can control autophagy and mitophagy by impinging on the metabolism of this fundamental amino acid."

The role of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is evolving, especially for high-risk potentially resectable tumors. Due to the increasing number of NAT resection specimens, we aim to characterize the histologic changes associated with NAT, and to compare two tumor regression grading schemes. 118 resections for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were selected from the cases between 2011-2018, 59 not treated and 59 treated with NAT. All H&amp;E stained tumor slides were reviewed for histologic changes and graded using the four-tier modified Ryan score (recommended by College of American Pathologists) and the three-tier MD Anderson score. The histologic changes evaluated included blue/grey fibrosis, islet cell hyperplasia, dystrophic calcification, amyloid deposition, cholesterol clefts, nerve hypertrophy, elastotic stromal/vascular change, abscess formation, and eosinophilic tumor cell changes. There were statistically significant differences for dystrophic calcification, eosinophilic tumor cell changes, elastotic stromal/vascular change, islet cell hyperplasia, and nerve hypertrophy between the two groups, with these features seen more frequently in NAT cases. Blue/grey stromal fibrosis was present in all cases regardless of NAT, except few complete regression cases and one treated case with intraneural invasion only. Blue/grey fibrosis is a useful histologic visual clue to suggest the possibility of adjacent tumor in the majority of PDAC cases regardless of NAT. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, neither grading scheme correlated with overall survival in our cohort. However, the MD Anderson score was significantly correlated with both time to primary tumor recurrence (p=0.002) and time to distant recurrence (p=0.04); while the modified Ryan score did not."

Similarly, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is known to be a key effector in immune response. MMP-9 interacts with NGAL, but their interaction mechanisms remain unclear. Functional interaction between proteins is ensured by coevolution. Protein coevolution was inferred by calculating the linear correlation coefficients between inter-protein distance matrices using MirrorTree. Among examined mammal species, we found a robust signal of MMP-9/NGAL coevolution exclusively within Primates (R=0.96, p&lt;1e-06). Owing to the high conservation of these proteins among Mammals, we chose to utilize a recent version of Blocks in Sequences (BIS2) algorithm implemented in BIS2Analyser webserver. Coevolution clusters between the two proteins were identified in MMP-9 fibronectin and hemopexin domains. Our results suggest that MMP-9/NGAL interaction is a recent evolutionary acquisition in Primates. Furthermore, MMP-9 hemopexin domain would represent a promising target for drug design against these molecules."

Here, we describe the performance of a novel stimulus-responsive nanoparticulate platform for the targeted treatment of prostate cancer using sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The nanoparticles were prepared by self-assembly of poly(L-glutamic acid-L-tyrosine) co-polymer with hematoporphyrin. The nanoparticulate formulation was characterized with respect to particle size, morphology, surface charge and singlet oxygen production during ultrasound exposure. The response of the formulation to the presence of cathepsin B, a proteolytic enzyme that is overexpressed and secreted in the tumour microenvironment of many solid tumours, was assessed. Our results showed that digestion with cathepsin B led to nanoparticle size reduction. In the absence of ultrasound, the formulation exhibited greater toxicity at acidic pH than at physiological pH, using the human prostate cells lines LNCaP and PC3 as targets. Nanoparticle cellular uptake was enhanced at acidic pH - a condition that was also associated with greater cathepsin B production. Nanoparticles exhibited enhanced ultrasound-induced cytotoxicity against both prostate cancer cell lines. Subsequent proof-of-concept in vivo studies demonstrated that, when ectopic human xenograft LNCaP tumours in SCID mice were treated with SDT using the systemically-administered nanoparticulate formulation at a single dose, tumour volumes decreased by up to 64% within 24 h. No adverse effects were observed in the nanoparticle-treated mice and their body weight remained stable. The potential of this novel formulation to deliver safe and effective treatment of prostate cancer is discussed."

Label=""MATERIAL AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":284 elderly HNSCC patients (≥65 years) undergoing curative (chemo)radiotherapy were included for the development of a score predicting overall survival (OS) based on the beta regression coefficients from significant parameters in a multivariate Cox regression analysis with p&lt;0.1 as inclusion criterion. A second, external cohort of 217 elderly HNSCC patients receiving (chemo)radiotherapy was used for validation. Using the aggregated data (n=501), a nomogram was developed to predict 2- and 4-year OS.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Karnofsky Performance Status (HR=2.654; p&lt;0.001), Charlson Comorbidity Index (HR=2.598; p&lt;0.001) and baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) level (HR=1.634; p=0.068) were prognostic for OS in the multivariate analysis. An OS score based on beta regression coefficients was created, in which reduced performance status, increased comorbidity burden and increased CRP levels were included, leading to 3 distinct survival groups. The median OS for the 3 groups amounted to 107, 28 and 6 months, respectively (p&lt;0.001). The developed score was able to significantly differentiate between a favorable (median OS=130 months), intermediate (29 months) and unfavorable prognosis (9 months) also in the external validation cohort (p=0.005).                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":We propose a novel, validated prognostic score based on easily accessible clinical data allowing stratification between prognostic groups of elderly HNSCC patients receiving (chemo)radiotherapy. The nomogram for the prediction of 2-year and 4-year OS may aid decision-making for this vulnerable population. "
"64","Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: Current Knowledge, Future Perspectives And Its Importance In Radiation Oncology.","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fibrotic lung disease with an unknown cause. Uncertainties still remain regarding the pathogenesis of IPF, and the prognosis of this disease is poor despite some recent improvements in treatment. Radiation induced lung injury (RILI) is a common complication and a dose-limiting toxicity of thoracic radiotherapy. Importantly, IPF is a crucial risk factor for pulmonary toxicity after thoracic radiotherapy. Although IPF is not universally accepted as a definite contraindication for thoracic radiotherapy at present, it has been shown that IPF can increase the risk of severe and fatal complications after thoracic radiotherapy. Proton beam therapy has shown promising results in reducing the incidence of thoracic radiotherapy related life-threatening complications in IPF patients, but the current evidence is not sufficient to recommend the standard use of it. Many similarities are noticeable between IPF and RILI in terms of pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms. Better understanding of the mechanisms of IPF and RILI may enable clinicians to provide safer and more effective thoracic radiotherapy treatments in cancer patients with IPF. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of IPF, present the importance of IPF in radiation oncology practice, and highlight the similarities and relationship between IPF and RILI."

Although a superspreader is an individual who undergoes more viral shedding and transmission than others, it appears likely that environmental factors have a substantial role in SSEs. We categorise SSEs into two distinct groups: 'societal' and 'isolated' SSEs.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We summarise SSEs that have occurred using multiple databases that have been cross referenced to ensure numbers are as reliable as we can ascertain. This enables more focussed and productive control of the current pandemic and future pandemics, especially as countries and regions ease lockdown restrictions.                 Label=""RESULTS AND DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":'Societal' SSEs pose a significant threat as members of the event are free to mingle and can infect individuals in the outside community. On the other hand, 'isolated' SSEs can be effectively quarantined as only a few individuals can transmit the virus from the isolated community to the outside community, therefore lowering further societal infection.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of screening with ultrasound (USS) and/or serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) on HCC-related mortality in patients with CHB.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We performed a matched case-control study of patients with CHB receiving care through the Veterans Affairs (VA) health administration. Cases were patients who died of HCC between 01/01/2004 and 12/31/2017, while controls were patients with CHB who did not die of HCC. Cases were matched to controls by CHB diagnosis date, age, sex, race/ethnicity, cirrhosis, antiviral therapy exposure, hepatitis B e antigen status, and viral load. We identified screening USS and AFPs obtained in the 4 years preceding HCC diagnosis in cases and the equivalent index date in controls. Using conditional logistic regression, we compared cases and controls with respect to receipt of screening. A lower likelihood of screening in cases corresponds to an association between screening and reduced risk of HCC-related mortality.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":We identified 169 cases, matched to 169 controls. Fewer cases than controls underwent screening with either screening modality (33.7% versus 58.6%) or both modalities (19.5% versus 34.4%). In multivariable conditional logistic regression, screening with either modality was associated with a lower risk of HCC-related mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09-0.50), as was screening with both modalities (aOR of 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.43).

The cytotoxicity, SCHL-induced autophagic, ferroptotic, and necroptotic cell death were evaluated by the resazurin reduction assay (RRA). Caspase-Glo assay was used to detect the activity of caspases using spectrophotometric analysis. Flow cytometry was applied for cell cycle analysis (PI staining), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (JC-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H2DCFH-DA). SCHL and doxorubicin (reference molecule) exhibited cytotoxic effects towards the 18 cancer cell lines tested. The IC50 values obtained ranged from 3.64 μM (towards CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) to 16.86 μM (against the BRAF-wildtype SKMel-505 melanoma cells for SCHL). Collateral sensitivity of the resistant HCT116 p53-/- colon adenocarcinoma cells to SCHL was observed as well as the normal sensitivity of CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells, MDA-MB-231-BCRP breast adenocarcinoma cells and U87. MGΔEGFR glioblastoma cells. SCHL induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells via caspases 3/7-, 8- and 9-activation, MMP alteration and increased ROS production, and otherwise ferroptosis and necroptosis. SCHL is a prominent cytotoxic alkaloid that should be further studied to develop a novel drug to combat cancers including refractory phenotypes."

"70","Combined 3-O-acetylbetulin treatment and carbonic anhydrase IX inhibition results in additive effects on human breast cancer cells.","Hypoxia plays a key role in tumor progression and resistance to radiotherapy. Expression of the transmembrane-tethered enzyme carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is strongly induced by hypoxia. High CA IX expression levels correlate with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Previously, we showed that the downregulation of CA IX expression by siRNA interference and the inhibition of CA IX activity results in increased cytotoxicity, inhibition of migration and radiosensitization of hypoxic cancer cells. Betulinic acid (BA) is a natural compound derived from birch bark. It has shown promising anti-tumor effects due to its cancer cell specific cytotoxic properties. We have shown that BA inhibits the HIF-1α pathway, resulting in apoptosis, inhibition of migration and enhanced cytotoxicity of breast cancer cells. In this study, we investigate the effects of the novel betulin derivative 3-O-acetylbetulin (3-AC) and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) octyl disulfamate (OCT) or 4-(3-[4-fluorophenyl]ureido)benzenesulfonamide (SLC-0111), on cellular and radiobiological parameters in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Treatment with 3-AC or OCT alone only caused moderate cytotoxicity, reduction in cell migration, ROS production and DNA damage. However, the combined treatment with 3-AC and CAI strongly enhanced radiosensitivity, increased cytotoxicity, inhibited cell motility and enhanced DNA damage. Our findings suggest that the combination of two bioactive drugs 3-AC and a CAI, such as OCT or SLC-0111, could be a promising therapeutic approach for targeting hypoxic tumor cells."

AI has proven to be capable of a spectrum of mundane to complex medically oriented tasks previously only performed by boarded physicians, most recently assisting detection of difficult-to-find cancer on histopathology slides. Although computers will not replace pathologists anytime soon, properly designed AI-based tools hold great potential to increase workflow efficiency and diagnostic accuracy in the practice of pathology. Recent trends, such as data augmentation, crowd-sourcing to generate annotated datasets, and unsupervised learning with molecular and/or clinical outcomes versus human diagnoses as a source of ground truth, are eliminating the direct role for pathologists in algorithm development. Proper integration of AI-based systems into anatomical pathology practice will necessarily require fully digital imaging platforms, an overhaul of legacy information technology infrastructures, modification of laboratory/pathologist workflows, appropriate reimbursement/cost-offsetting models, and ultimately, active participation of pathologists to encourage buy-in and oversight. Regulations tailored to the nature and limitations of AI are currently in development and, when instituted, should promote safe and effective use. This review addresses the challenges in AI development, deployment and regulation to be overcome prior to its widespread adoption in anatomical pathology."
"74","Long non-coding RNA HCP5 in cancer.","Cancer remains a major threat to human health worldwide. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) comprise a group of single-stranded RNA with lengths longer than 200 bp. LncRNAs are aberrantly expressed and play a variety of roles involving multiple cellular processes in cancer. Histocompatibility leukocyte antigen complex P5 (HCP5), initially reported in 1993, is an important lncRNA located between the MICA and MICB genes in MHC I region. HCP5 is involved many autoimmune diseases as well as malignancy. Abnormal HCP5 expression occurs in many types of cancer and its dysregulation appears closely associated with progression. HCP5 is also involved in anti-tumor drug resistance as well. As such, HCP5 represents a promising biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer. In this review, we summarize recent research and provide an overview of the role and mechanism of HCP5 in human cancer."

During the sampling period, total of 14 PAH (∑14PAH) concentrations measured in the olive leaves (dissolved and particle phase) and braches (1- and 2-year-old) were 593±472, 81±67, 558±273 and 316±213 ng/g dry weight (DW), respectively. Similarly, the average ∑14PAH concentrations measured in the ambient air was found to be 15±16 ng/m3. Generally, 4-, 5- and 6- ring PAHs were the dominant groups for all tree components, while 2- and 3-ring PAHs were predominant in the air samples. Ring distributions and molecular diagnosis ratios were employed to determine PAH sources in the sampling site. Petroleum and combustion-related sources were found to be important. The Pearson correlation coefficient was allowed to figure out the affinity between PAH levels in the sampling materials and meteorological factors. Temperature and mixing layer height were found to be effective factors on the concentrations. Atmospheric PAH levels were also predicted to employ a bark-air exchange model for determining the PAH movement direction. The predicted/measured ratios were above 1.0. This was probably due to utilizing the branch values rather than bark values in the model. Finally, the risk of cancer has been evaluated. The calculated cancer risks via inhalation were at low levels for adults and children."
"76","Effects of fetuin-A with diverse functions and multiple mechanisms on human health.","Fetuin-A (Alfa 2-Heremans-Schmid) is a glycoprotein that is mainly synthesized by hepatocytes and then released into the bloodstream. While fetuin-A, a multifunctional protein, has inhibitory effects on health in the processes of calcification, mineralization, coronary artery calcification (CAC), and kidney stone formation by various mechanisms, it has such stimulatory effects as obesity, diabetes, and tumor progression processes. Fetuin-A produces these effects on the organism mainly by playing a role in the secretion levels of some inflammatory cytokines and exosomes, preventing unwanted calcification, inhibiting the autophosphorylation of tyrosine kinase, suppressing the release of adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), activating the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), triggering the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase/Akt signaling pathway and cell proliferation, and mimicking the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) receptor. In the present review, fetuin-A was examined in a wide perspective from the structure and release of fetuin-A to its effects on health."
"77","Missense variants in the N-terminal domain of the A isoform of FHF2/FGF13 cause an X-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.","Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) are intracellular proteins which regulate voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels in the brain and other tissues. FHF dysfunction has been linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy. Here, we describe two sibling pairs and three unrelated males who presented in infancy with intractable focal seizures and severe developmental delay. Whole-exome sequencing identified hemi- and heterozygous variants in the N-terminal domain of the A isoform of FHF2 (FHF2A). The X-linked FHF2 gene (also known as FGF13) has alternative first exons which produce multiple protein isoforms that differ in their N-terminal sequence. The variants were located at highly conserved residues in the FHF2A inactivation particle that competes with the intrinsic fast inactivation mechanism of Nav channels. Functional characterization of mutant FHF2A co-expressed with wild-type Nav1.6 (SCN8A) revealed that mutant FHF2A proteins lost the ability to induce rapid-onset, long-term blockade of the channel while retaining pro-excitatory properties. These gain-of-function effects are likely to increase neuronal excitability consistent with the epileptic potential of FHF2 variants. Our findings demonstrate that FHF2 variants are a cause of infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and underline the critical role of the FHF2A isoform in regulating Nav channel function."
"78","Integrative Imaging Reveals SARS-CoV-2-Induced Reshaping of Subcellular Morphologies.","Pathogenesis induced by SARS-CoV-2 is thought to result from both an inflammation-dominated cytokine response and virus-induced cell perturbation causing cell death. Here, we employ an integrative imaging analysis to determine morphological organelle alterations induced in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung epithelial cells. We report 3D electron microscopy reconstructions of whole cells and subcellular compartments, revealing extensive fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, alteration of the mitochondrial network and recruitment of peroxisomes to viral replication organelles formed by clusters of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). These are tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum, providing insights into DMV biogenesis and spatial coordination of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Live cell imaging combined with an infection sensor reveals profound remodeling of cytoskeleton elements. Pharmacological inhibition of their dynamics suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication. We thus report insights into virus-induced cytopathic effects and provide alongside a comprehensive publicly available repository of 3D datasets of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells for download and smooth online visualization."

Risk perceptions and factors that influence management choices were explored.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":There were 123 respondents. A substantial proportion (29%) of the dysplasia-experienced respondents did not feel well informed about the associated cancer risk and/or its management by their clinical team. Contributing themes included: contradictory advice and lack of personalised information regarding their cancer risk, alternative management options and impact on long-term quality of life. Decisional regret and health-related quality of life amongst those who chose either surveillance or surgery were comparable, but cancer-related worry scores were elevated in the surveillance group. The dysplasia-naïve respondents reported that they would only consider having a prophylactic colectomy if they had on average a 50% or even higher risk of developing cancer. On multivariable logistic regression analyses, predictors of colectomy or surveillance preference included ethnicity, personality traits such as health locus of control (whether health status is influenced by luck) and differences in perception of what a 'low' risk of cancer is.

Management of breakthrough bleeding in patients with inhibitors on emicizumab involves episodic treatment with bypassing agents (BPA), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa). Thrombotic events and thrombotic microangiopathy were reported when patients on emicizumab received concomitant aPCC at relatively high doses yet such events were not reported with rFVIIa. We studied the effect of spiking various concentrations of BPA on plasma taken from patients on emicizumab.                 Label=""MATERIAL AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Eleven patients with severe haemophilia A with inhibitors who are on emicizumab were recruited to participate. Blood samples drawn from patients were spiked in vitro with varying concentrations of aPCC and rFVIIa. All samples were tested utilizing global haemostasis assays, thromboelastography and thrombin generation assay.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Thrombin generation increased with higher concentrations of spiked BPA with a normalized endogenous thrombin potential at a concentration of 0.05 IU/ml and 4 mcg/ml for aPCC and rFVIIa, respectively. Concentrations of aPCC in the range of licensed dosing led to excessive thrombin generation. Thromboelastography was not sufficiently sensitive.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Due to the known thrombotic complications when emicizumab is used in conjunction with aPCC, there has been a large-scale abandonment of the use of aPCC in patients on emicizumab. However, it is possible that aPCC can be used safely with emicizumab albeit with lower doses than are typically prescribed. It would be important to test this hypothesis in a clinical study. "

We aim to investigate the differences of gut microbiota between the male and female.                 Label=""METHODS AND RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":We reanalyzed the dataset in a published project from a sex perspective at the community level by characterizing the gut microbiome in patients (including males and females) from three clinical groups representative of the stages of CRC development: healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma. The results indicated that the microbial α-diversity showed no significant difference in the male gut but had decreased significantly in the female gut with the development of CRC. In males, a significant difference in the microbial β-diversity was only observed between the healthy and carcinoma subgroups. However, significant community deviations were detected with the development of CRC in females. The microbial community assembly processes changed from deterministic to stochastic in males, whereas they became increasingly deterministic in females with the development of CRC. Moreover, microbial co-occurrence associations tended to be more complicated in males; rare species were enriched in the co-occurrence network of the male gut, whereas key species loss was observed in the co-occurrence network of the female gut.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":The microbial communities in the male gut were more stable than those in the female gut, and microbial community assembly in the gut was sex dependent with the development of CRC.

In cancer, various types of large-scale genomic rearrangements can disrupt the 3D genome, leading to oncogenic gene expression. However, unraveling the pathogenicity of the 3D cancer genome remains a challenge since closer examinations have been greatly limited due to the lack of appropriate tools specialized for disorganized higher-order chromatin structure. Here, we updated a 3D-genome Interaction Viewer and database named 3DIV by uniformly processing ∼230 billion raw Hi-C reads to expand our contents to the 3D cancer genome. The updates of 3DIV are listed as follows: (i) the collection of 401 samples including 220 cancer cell line/tumor Hi-C data, 153 normal cell line/tissue Hi-C data, and 28 promoter capture Hi-C data, (ii) the live interactive manipulation of the 3D cancer genome to simulate the impact of structural variations and (iii) the reconstruction of Hi-C contact maps by user-defined chromosome order to investigate the 3D genome of the complex genomic rearrangement. In summary, the updated 3DIV will be the most comprehensive resource to explore the gene regulatory effects of both the normal and cancer 3D genome. '3DIV' is freely available at http://3div.kr."

Nevertheless, its specific mechanism in driving drug-resistance remains unclear. We present evidence that S70pBcl2 promotes cancer cell survival by acting as a redox sensor and modulator to prevent oxidative stress-induced DNA damage and execution. Increased S70pBcl2 levels are inversely correlated with DNA damage in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lymphoma patient-derived primary cells as well as in reactive oxygen species (ROS)- or chemotherapeutic drug-treated cell lines. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that S70pBcl2 is associated with lower median overall survival in lymphoma patients. Empirically, sustained expression of the redox-sensitive S70pBcl2 prevents oxidative stress-induced DNA damage and cell death by suppressing mitochondrial ROS production. Using cell lines and lymphoma primary cells, we further demonstrate that S70pBcl2 reduces the interaction of Bcl-2 with the mitochondrial complex-IV subunit-5A, thereby reducing mitochondrial complex-IV activity, respiration and ROS production. Notably, targeting S70pBcl2 with the phosphatase activator, FTY720, is accompanied by an enhanced drug-induced DNA damage and cell death in CLL primary cells. Collectively, we provide a novel facet of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 by demonstrating that its phosphorylation at serine-70 functions as a redox sensor to prevent drug-induced oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage and execution with potential therapeutic implications."
"88","BCCIP is required for nucleolar recruitment of eIF6 and 12S pre-rRNA production during 60S ribosome biogenesis.","Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental process required for cell proliferation. Although evolutionally conserved, the mammalian ribosome assembly system is more complex than in yeasts. BCCIP was originally identified as a BRCA2 and p21 interacting protein. A partial loss of BCCIP function was sufficient to trigger genomic instability and tumorigenesis. However, a complete deletion of BCCIP arrested cell growth and was lethal in mice. Here, we report that a fraction of mammalian BCCIP localizes in the nucleolus and regulates 60S ribosome biogenesis. Both abrogation of BCCIP nucleolar localization and impaired BCCIP-eIF6 interaction can compromise eIF6 recruitment to the nucleolus and 60S ribosome biogenesis. BCCIP is vital for a pre-rRNA processing step that produces 12S pre-rRNA, a precursor to the 5.8S rRNA. However, a heterozygous Bccip loss was insufficient to impair 60S biogenesis in mouse embryo fibroblasts, but a profound reduction of BCCIP was required to abrogate its function in 60S biogenesis. These results suggest that BCCIP is a critical factor for mammalian pre-rRNA processing and 60S generation and offer an explanation as to why a subtle dysfunction of BCCIP can be tumorigenic but a complete depletion of BCCIP is lethal."
"89","MicroRNA-based regulation of Aurora A kinase in breast cancer.","The involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in cellular physiology and disease pathogenesis is becoming increasingly relevant in recent years specifically in cancer research. Breast cancer (BC) has become a health concern and accounts for most of the cancer-related incidences and mortalities reported amongst females. In spite of the presence of promising tools for BC therapy, the mortality rate of metastatic BC cases is still high. Therefore, the genomic exploration of the BC subtype and the use of ncRNAs for possible regulation is pivotal. The expression and prognostic values of AURKA gene were assessed by Oncomine, GEPIA, KM-plotter, and bc-GenExMiner v4.4, respectively. Associated proteins and functional enrichment were evaluated by Cytoscape and DAVID databases. Additionally, molecular docking approach was employed to investigate the regulatory role of hsa-miR-32-3p assisted argonaute (AGO) protein of AURKA gene in BC. AURKA gene was highly expressed in patients with BC relative to normal counterpart and significantly correlated with poor survival. The docking result suggested that AURKA could be regulated by hsa-miR-32-3p as confirmed by the reported binding energy and specific interactions. The study gives some insights into role of AURKA and its regulation by microRNAs through AGO protein. It also provides exciting opportunities for cancer therapeutic intervention."
"90","MEK inhibitors reduce cellular expression of ACE2, pERK, pRb while stimulating NK-mediated cytotoxicity and attenuating inflammatory cytokines relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","COVID-19 affects vulnerable populations including elderly individuals and patients with cancer. Natural Killer (NK) cells and innate-immune TRAIL suppress transformed and virally-infected cells. ACE2, and TMPRSS2 protease promote SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, while inflammatory cytokines IL-6, or G-CSF worsen COVID-19 severity. We show MEK inhibitors (MEKi) VS-6766, trametinib and selumetinib reduce ACE2 expression in human cells. In some human cells, remdesivir increases ACE2-promoter luciferase-reporter expression, ACE2 mRNA and protein, and ACE2 expression is attenuated by MEKi. In serum-deprived and stimulated cells treated with remdesivir and MEKi we observed correlations between pRB, pERK, and ACE2 expression further supporting role of proliferative state and MAPK pathway in ACE2 regulation. We show elevated cytokines in COVID-19-(+) patient plasma (N = 9) versus control (N = 11). TMPRSS2, inflammatory cytokines G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-1α, IL-6 and MCP-1 are suppressed by MEKi alone or with remdesivir. We observed MEKi stimulation of NK-cell killing of target-cells, without suppressing TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity. Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus with a lentiviral core and SARS-CoV-2 D614 or G614 SPIKE (S) protein on its envelope infected human bronchial epithelial cells, small airway epithelial cells, or lung cancer cells and MEKi suppressed infectivity of the pseudovirus. We show a drug class-effect with MEKi to stimulate NK cells, inhibit inflammatory cytokines and block host-factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection leading also to suppression of SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus infection of human cells. MEKi may attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infection to allow immune responses and antiviral agents to control disease progression."
"92","Intracellular hyaluronic acid-binding protein 4 (HABP4): a candidate tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer.","Hyaluronic Acid-binding protein 4 (HABP4) is a regulatory protein of 57 kDa that is functionally involved in transcription regulation and RNA metabolism and shows several characteristics common to oncoproteins or tumor suppressors, including altered expression in cancer tissues, nucleus/cytoplasm shuttling, intrinsic lack of protein structure, complex interactomes and post translational modifications. Its gene has been found in a region on chromosome 9q22.3-31, which contains SNP haplotypes occurring in individuals with a high risk for familial colon cancer. To test a possible role of HABP4 in tumorigenesis we generated knockout mice by the CRISPR/Cas9 method and treated the animals with azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for induction of colon tumors. HABP4-/- mice, compared to wild type mice, had more and larger tumors, and expressed more of the proliferation marker proteins Cyclin-D1, CDK4 and PCNA. Furthermore, the cells of the bottom of the colon crypts in the HABP4-/- mice divided more rapidly. Next, we generated also HABP4-/- HCT 116 cells, in cell culture and found again an increased proliferation in clonogenic assays in comparison to wild-type cells. Our study of the protein expression levels of HABP4 in human colon cancer samples, through immunohistochemistry assays, showed, that 30% of the tumors analyzed had low expression of HABP4. Our data suggest that HABP4 is involved in proliferation regulation of colon cells in vitro and in vivo and that it is a promising new candidate for a tumor suppressor protein that can be explored both in the diagnosis and possibly therapy of colon cancer."
"93","Immune profiling of the bone marrow microenvironment in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer.","Bone marrow (BM) is a primary metastatic site in prostate cancer (PC) and bone invasion is considered incurable. T cell-mediated immune surveillance is essential in controlling both tumorigenesis and initiation of metastases. Beside tropism, dissemination of PC cells to the BM may be facilitated by defects in BM immune homeostasis predisposing this niche to colonization. To evaluate the BM immune microenvironment in locally advanced, non-metastatic PC, we performed flow cytometry analysis of myeloid and lymphoid subsets in BM aspirates and peripheral blood collected during prostatectomy. Healthy BM aspirates served to establish a reference range for comparison. We found alterations in BM immune composition of PC patients, including an increased CD4/CD8 ratio, enrichment of CD4+ T cells, increased CD56+CD3+ NKT and CD56+CD3- NK yields compared to healthy controls. The lymphoid phenotype remained comparable regarding T cell activation and chemokine receptor-based polarization patterns. Additionally, we found increased B7H3 expression in the myeloid monocyte/macrophage subset and decreased DC infiltration in BM of PC patients. These findings suggest that alterations in the immune milieu may limit immune surveillance that compromise the ability of the BM microenvironment to prevent tumor dissemination, and predispose development of bone metastases in a subset of patients with localized PC."

"95","HER2 splice variants in breast cancer: investigating their impact on diagnosis and treatment outcomes.","Overexpression of the HER2 receptor occurs in approximately 20% of breast cancer patients. HER2 positivity is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumour phenotypes, which led to rapid progress in HER2 targeted therapeutics and diagnostic testing. Whilst these advances have greatly increased patients' chances of survival, resistance to HER2 targeted therapies, be that intrinsic or acquired, remains a problem. Different forms of the HER2 protein exist within tumours in tandem and can display altered biological activities. Interest in HER2 variants in breast cancer increased when links between resistance to anti-HER2 therapies and a particular variant, Δ16-HER2, were identified. Moreover, the P100 variant potentially reduces the efficacy of the anti-HER2 therapy trastuzumab. Another variant, Herstatin, exhibits 'auto-inhibitory' behaviour. More recently, new HER2 variants have been identified and are currently being assessed for their pro- and anti-cancer properties. It is important when directing the care of patients to consider HER2 variants collectively. This review considers HER2 variants in the context of the tumour environment where multiple variants are co-expressed at altered ratios. This study also provides an up to date account of the landscape of HER2 variants and links this to patterns of resistance against HER2 therapies and treatment plans."
"96","A case report of androgen receptor inhibitor therapy in recurrent high-grade serous ovarian cancer.","Ovarian cancer is common gynaecological malignancy and a leading cause of death among women. Despite the advances in treatment strategies, majority of patients present with recurrence after first- or second-line treatment. Targeted therapy that has proven to be effective in other advanced or metastatic solid tumors have also demonstrated its efficacy in ovarian cancer. Recent studies have shown that the androgen receptor (AR) signalling is involved in pathogenicity and progression of cancer. Current observations suggest AR could be a potential target in managing the disease. In this case report we present a patient with high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) with multiple relapses with excellent disease control on AR inhibition with bicalutamide."
"97","Evaluating Six Commercially Available Closed-System Drug-Transfer Devices Against NIOSH's 2015 Draft Vapor Protocol.","Purpose: In 2015, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published a draft vapor containment protocol to quantitatively evaluate combined liquid, aerosol, and vapor containment performance of commercially available closed-system drug-transfer devices (CSTDs) that claim to be effective for gas/vapor containment within a controlled test environment. Until the release of this proposed protocol, no standard method for evaluating airtightness of CSTDs existed. The aim of this study was to evaluate six commercially available CSTDs utilizing NIOSH draft protocol methodology to evaluate vapor containment under a robust vapor challenge. Methods: In this study, six commercially available CSTDs were tested utilizing draft NIOSH vapor containment protocol methodology to simulate drug compounding and administration using 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as the challenge agent. All device manipulations were carried out in an enclosed test chamber. A Miran sapphIRe gas analyzer was used to detect IPA vapor levels that escaped the device. Study test included the two tasks designated by the NIOSH protocol, with additional steps added to the evaluation. Tasks were repeated 10 times for each device. Results: Only three of the six tested CSTDs (Equashield®, HALO®, and PhaSealTM) had an average IPA vapor release below the quantifiable performance threshold (1.0 ppm) for all tasks performed. This value was selected by NIOSH to represent the performance threshold for successful containment. The remaining three CSTDs had vapor release above 1 ppm at various times during the IPA manipulation process. Conclusion: Equashield®, HALO®, and PhaSealTM devices tested met the 2015 NIOSH protocol quantifiable performance threshold, functioning as a truly closed system. Quantifiable effective data may be useful in product selection."
"98","Auto-antibodies against apolipoprotein A-1 block cancer cells proliferation and induce apoptosis.","Auto-antibodies against apoA-1 (anti-apoA-1 IgGs) have been identified as important actors of atherosclerosis development through pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic properties and to also induce apoptosis in tumoral neuronal and lymphocyte derived cell lines through unknown mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to explore the cellular pathways involved in tumoral cell survival modulated by anti-apoA-1 antibodies. We observed that anti-apoA-1 antibodies induce growth arrest (in G2/M phase) and cell apoptosis through caspase 3 activation, accompanied by a selective p53 phosphorylation on serine 15. RNA sequencing indicated that anti-apoA-1 IgGs affect the expression of more than 950 genes belonging to five major groups of genes and respectively involved in i) cell proliferation inhibition, ii) p53 stabilisation and regulation, iii) apoptosis regulation, iv) inflammation regulation, and v) oxidative stress. In conclusion, anti-apoA-1 antibodies seem to have a role in blocking tumoral cell proliferation and survival, by activating a major tumor suppressor protein and by modulating the inflammatory and oxidative stress response. Further investigations are needed to explore a possible anti-cancer therapeutic approach of these antibodies in very specific and circumscribed conditions."
"99","Evidence for context-dependent functions of KDM5B in prostate development and prostate cancer.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Prostate tumorigenesis and PCa progression involve numerous genetic as well as epigenetic perturbations. Histone modification represents a fundamental epigenetic mechanism that regulates diverse cellular processes, and H3K4 methylation, one such histone modification associated with active transcription, can be reversed by dedicated histone demethylase KDM5B (JARID1B). Abnormal expression and functions of KDM5B have been implicated in several cancer types including PCa. Consistently, our bioinformatics analysis reveals that the KDM5B mRNA levels are upregulated in PCa compared to benign prostate tissues, and correlate with increased tumor grade and poor patient survival, supporting an oncogenic function of KDM5B in PCa. Surprisingly, however, when we generated prostate-specific conditional Kdm5b knockout mice using probasin (Pb) promoter-driven Cre: loxP system, we observed that Kdm5b deletion did not affect normal prostate development but instead induced mild hyperplasia. These results suggest that KDM5B may possess context-dependent roles in normal prostate development vs. PCa development and progression."
"100","Role of Exosomes in the Progression, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Gliomas.","Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors associated with a low survival rate. Even after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, gliomas still have a poor prognosis. Extracellular vesicles are a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous structures. Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicles, their size ranges from 30 nm to 100 nm. Recent studies have proved that glioma cells could release numerous exosomes; therefore, exosomes have gained increasing attention in glioma-related research. Recent studies have confirmed the importance of extracellular vesicles, particularly exosomes, in the development of brain tumors, including gliomas. Exosomes mediate intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment by transporting biomolecules (proteins, lipids, deoxyribonucleic acid, and ribonucleic acid); thereby playing a prominent role in tumor proliferation, differentiation, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy or radiation. Given their nanoscale size, exosomes can traverse the blood-brain barrier and promote tumor progression by modifying the tumor microenvironment. Based on their structural and functional characteristics, exosomes are demonstrating their value not only as diagnostic and prognostic markers, but also as tools in therapies specifically targeting glioma cells. Therefore, exosomes are a promising therapeutic target for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of malignant gliomas. More research will be needed before exosomes can be used in clinical applications. Here, we describe the exosomes, their morphology, and their roles in the diagnosis and progression of gliomas. In addition, we discuss the potential of exosomes as a therapeutic target/drug delivery system for patients with gliomas."
