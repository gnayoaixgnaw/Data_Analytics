"1","Primary Obesity Surgery Endoluminal (POSE-2) For Treatment of Obesity In Clinical Practice.","Introduction POSE-2 procedure shortens and narrows the stomach using multiple full-thickness plications in the gastric body. We studied the efficacy and safety of POSE-2 for obesity at 1-year in a real-world setting. Methods We reviewed the records of 75 patients who underwent POSE-2 at our unit. The primary outcome was to evaluate the %total body weight loss (%TBWL) at 1-year. Our secondary outcome was to assess the safety and durability. We used linear mixed model analysis. RESULTS: Forty-six patients completed 1-year. The rest are in various phases of follow-up. The mean(SD) age and BMI was 49.3(10.2) years and 38.2(6.6) kg/m2, respectively. The technical success rate was 98.7% (n=74). The mean(SD) TBWL, %TBWL, and the BMI decline at 1-year were 20(12.7) kg, 17.8(9.5)%, 7(4.3) kg/m2. Adverse events occurred in 4 patients. The average length of stay was 1-day. Endoscopy at 1-year in 15 patients showed intact sutures and a reduction in gastric length compared to baseline [35.7(3.5) cm vs. 26.9(5.3) cm, p&lt;0.001] CONCLUSION: POSE-2 induced significant weight loss at 1-year. It is safe, durable and required only a short hospital stay."

Label=""STUDY DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort study.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Data from 1849 individuals were analyzed. COVID-19 was confirmed (reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction) in 15.9% of patients, and factors predicting a positive test result were evaluated through prevalence odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Increasing age, personal history of obesity, and household contact with a case were found to be associated, in the multiple regression model, with increased odds of a positive test result. Young patients residing in areas with higher population sizes, as well as those with severe respiratory symptoms, were less likely to be laboratory confirmed.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Early identification and isolation of children and teenagers with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 is important to limit viral spread. We identified several factors predicting the laboratory test result. Our findings are relevant from a public health policy perspective, particularly after the restart of in-person academic activities. "
"3","Direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism in patients with obesity: A systematic review with meta-analysis.","                 Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"":Direct oral anticoagulants' (DOAC) pharmacokinetics are affected by obesity. Their efficacy and safety in obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) and morbid obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) are still unclear in the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE).                 Label=""OBJECTIVES"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"":To compare the efficacy/safety of DOAC versus vitamin K antagonist (VKA)/low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for the treatment of VTE in patients with obesity and morbid obesity. The primary efficacy/safety outcomes were VTE recurrence and major bleeding (MB). Clinically relevant non-MB and mortality were also evaluated.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A systematic literature search (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science) identified studies evaluating DOAC in the treatment of VTE in patients with obesity and reporting one of the outcomes. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel method.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":We included 21 studies (50,360pts) of which 16,150 patients had a BMI≥30 kg/m2 and 6,443 patients had a BMI≥40 kg/m2. VTE recurrence was similar with DOAC compared to VKA/LMWH in patients with obesity (RR 1.03;95%CI 0.93-1.15;p = 0.55) and morbid obesity (RR 1.06;95CI 0.94-1.19;p = 0.35). DOAC were also associated with a reduction in MB (RR 0.57;95%CI 0.34-0.94;p = 0.03 and RR 0.71;95%CI 0.50-1.00;p = 0.05 in patients with obesity and morbid obesity, respectively). Subgroup analyses comparing randomized controlled trials to observational studies showed consistent results. No difference was observed in regards of clinically relevant non-MB and mortality.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":There is no signal for differences in VTE recurrence in patients with obesity and morbid obesity treated with DOAC compared to VKA/LMWH, while DOAC likely reduce the risk of MB compared to VKA/LMWH.

"4","Farnesol induces mitochondrial/peroxisomal biogenesis and thermogenesis by enhancing the AMPK signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.","Thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue has been considered as an obesity treatment strategy that consumes energy. In this study, we investigated whether farnesol in vivo and in vitro models induces thermogenesis and affect the activation of the mitochondria and peroxisomes, which are key organelles in activated brown adipocytes. Farnesol induced the expression of thermogenic factors such as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α), and PR domain zinc-finger protein 16 (PRDM16) together with the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKα) in brown adipose tissue and primary cultured brown adipocytes. Farnesol promoted lipolytic enzymes: hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipose tissue triacylglycerol (ATGL). We confirmed that these inductions of lipolysis by farnesol were the underlying causes of β-oxidation activation. Farnesol also increased the expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the expansion of peroxisomes. Moreover, we proved that the thermogenic activity of farnesol was dependent on AMPKα activation using Compound C inhibitor or siRNA-AMPKα knockdown. These results suggest that farnesol may be a potential agent for the treatment of obesity by inducing energy consumption through heat generation."
"5","&quot;A LEAP 2 Conclusions?: Targeting the Ghrelin System to Treat Obesity and Diabetes&quot;.","                 Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"":The hormone ghrelin stimulates food intake, promotes adiposity, increases body weight, and elevates blood glucose. Consquently, alterations in plasma ghrelin levels and the functioning of other components of the broader ghrelin system have been proposed as potential contributors to obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, targeting the ghrelin system has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy for obesity and diabetes.                 Label=""SCOPE OF REVIEW"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":The current review focuses on the potential for targeting ghrelin and other proteins comprising the ghrelin system as a treatment for obesity and diabetes. The main components of the ghrelin system are introduced. Data supporting a role for the endogenous ghrelin system in the development of obesity and diabetes along with data that seemingly refute such a role are outlined. An argument for further research into the development of ghrelin system-targeted therapeutic agents is delineated. Also, an evidence-based discussion of potential factors and contexts that might influence the efficacy of this class of therapeutics is provided.                 Label=""MAJOR CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":It would not be a &quot;leap to&quot; conclusions to suggest that agents which target the ghrelin system - including those that lower acyl-ghrelin levels, raise LEAP2 levels, block GHSR activity, and/or raise desacyl-ghrelin signaling - could represent efficacious novel treatments for obesity and diabetes.

"6","Intestinal stem cell derived enteroids from morbidly obese patients preserve obesity-related phenotypes: elevated glucose absorption and gluconeogenesis.","                 Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"":The mechanisms behind the efficacy of bariatric surgery (BS) in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes, particularly with respect to the influence of the small bowel, remain poorly understood. In vitro and animal models are suboptimal with respect to their ability to replicate the human intestinal epithelium under conditions induced by obesity. Human enteroids have the potential to accelerate development of less invasive anti-obesity therapeutics if they can recapitulate the pathophysiology of obesity. Our aim was to determine whether adult stem-cell derived enteroids preserve obesity-characteristic patient-specific abnormalities in carbohydrate absorption and metabolism.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We established twenty-four enteroid lines representing nineteen lean, overweight, or morbidly obese patients, including post-BS cases. Dietary glucose absorption and gluconeogenesis in enteroids were measured. Expression of carbohydrate transporters and gluconeogenic enzymes was assessed and pharmacological approach was used to dissect the specific contribution of each transporter or enzyme to carbohydrate absorption and metabolism, respectively.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Four phenotypes representing the relationship between patients' BMI and intestinal dietary sugar absorption were found, suggesting that human enteroids retain the obese patient phenotype heterogeneity. Intestinal glucose absorption and gluconeogenesis were significantly elevated in enteroids from a cohort of obese patients. Elevated glucose absorption was associated with increased expression of SGLT1 and GLUT2, whereas elevated gluconeogenesis was associated with increased expression of GLUT5, PEPCK1 and G6Pase.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Obesity phenotypes preserved in human enteroids provide a mechanistic link to aberrant dietary carbohydrate absorption and metabolism. Enteroids can be used as a preclinical platform to understand the pathophysiology of obesity, study the heterogeneity of obesity mechanisms and identify novel therapeutics. "

(sage), and Chamaemelum nobile (L.) (chamomile) have been used traditionally to treat various inflammatory conditions.                 Label=""AIMS"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"":Our study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of both plant extracts in IL-1β-stimulated neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH) and human subcutaneous mature adipocytes, as well as their potential protective effects against mature adipocytes conditioned media (ACM)-induced neuro-inflammation.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Human subcutaneous mature adipocytes and neuroblastoma cells were treated with 5μg/ml (low dose: LD) and 50 μg/ml (high dose: HD) of each extract, with or without 0.5 ng/ml of human recombinant IL-1β. To understand the cross talk between fat tissue and neuronal cells, SK-N-SH cell line was incubated with ACM 10%, in presence or absence of both extracts LD and HD. Following 4, and 24 hours incubation, the released MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and SAA levels were measured using MSD Cytokines and Chemokines assay kits, and the cells were used for gene expression. RNA was quantified using Qubit™ RNA HS Assay. RNA aliquots were shipped to Eurofins Genomics (Aarhus, Denmark) for expression analysis on the human Clariom™ GO Screen Assay (952361; ThermoFisher).                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Chamomile showed stronger effects compared to sage in both cell lines, at 4 and 24h. Adipocytes acute treatment with sage decreased MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8 (p&lt;0.001), and TNF-α (p&lt;0.05) basal levels. This was mirrored at MCP-1 transcriptional level. Chronic treatment with both extracts resulted in a significant reduction in ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and SAA (p&lt;0.001) levels, in IL-1β-stimulated adipocytes. However, in SK-N-SH cells, sage increased the basal levels of many cytokines and chemokines on both protein and transcriptional levels. This was also observed in IL-1β-stimulated cells. In chamomile treated SK-N-SH cells, acute and chronic treatments decreased MCP-1 (p&lt;0.001), IL-6 (p&lt;0.01), TNF-α (p&lt;0.01), and IL-8 (p&lt;0.001) basal levels. In IL1-β-stimulated SK-N-SH cells, chamomile HD induced a significant reduction in TNF-α after both acute and chronic treatments respectively, by 52% and 81%. At transcriptional level, this effect was only reflected at 4h. ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and SAA levels were reduced in most of the studied conditions. In IL-1β treated adipocytes, chamomile showed stronger reduction in MCP-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, however no significant reduction in TNF-α and IL-8 was observed, despite the decrease in basal levels. In SK-N-SH cells, ACM increased MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, VCAM-1 and SAA levels. Sage HD acute treatment resulted in a reduction of ACM effect on IL-6, IL-8 and VCAM-1, with greater effect of chamomile on MCP-1 (p&lt;0.05); IL-6 (p&lt;0.001); TNF-α (p&lt;0.001); VCAM-1 (p&lt;0.001); and SAA (p&lt;0.001). This protective effect was also observed after chronic treatment. However, both extracts potentiated significantly the ACM-pro-inflammatory effect on IL-8 (p&lt;0.001).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Sage decreased the pro-inflammatory markers mostly in human adipocytes, whereas chamomile showed a strong reduction in both cell populations. Both extracts reduced the ACM-induced inflammation effect and might be used as a preventive treatment for late-life cognitive impairment related to low-grade chronic inflammation associated with obesity. Further studies are needed to investigate their combination on other chronic inflammation-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. "

Label=""AIM"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"":To show that visceral fat accumulation better predicts severity of COVID-19 outcome compared to either SCF amounts or BMI.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We selected patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and a computed tomography (CT) scan. Severe COVID-19 was defined as requirement for mechanical ventilation or death. Fat depots were quantified on abdominal CT scan slices and the measurements were correlated with the clinical outcomes. ACE 2 mRNA levels were quantified in fat depots of a separate group of non-COVID-19 subjects using RT-qPCR.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Among 165 patients with a mean BMI of 26.1 ± 5.4 kg/m2, VF was associated with severe COVID-19 (p = 0.022) and SCF was not (p = 0.640). Subcutaneous fat was not different in patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and the SCF/VF ratio was lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (p = 0.010). The best predictive value for severe COVID-19 was found for a VF area ≥ 128.5 cm2 (ROC curve), which was independently associated with COVID-19 severity (p &lt; 0.001). In an exploratory analysis, ACE 2 mRNA positively correlated with BMI in VF but not in SCF of non-COVID-19 patients (r2 = 0.27 vs 0.0008).                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Severe forms of COVID-19 are associated with high visceral adiposity in European adults. On the basis of an exploratory analysis ACE 2 in the visceral fat may be a trigger for the cytokine storm, and this needs to be clarified by future studies. "
"9","Evaluation of VGF peptides as potential anti-obesity candidates in pre-clinical animal models.","VGF is a peptide precursor expressed in neuroendocrine cells that is suggested to play a role in the regulation of energy homeostasis. VGF is proteolytically cleaved to yield multiple bioactive peptides. However, the specific actions of VGF-derived peptides on energy homeostasis remain unclear. The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of VGF-derived peptides in energy homeostasis and explore the pharmacological actions of VGF-derived peptides on body weight in preclinical animal models. VGF-derived peptides (NERP-1, NERP-2, PGH-NH2, PGH-OH, NERP-4, TLQP-21, TLQP-30, TLQP-62, HHPD-41, AQEE-30, and LQEQ-19) were synthesized and screened for their ability to affect neuronal activity in vitro on hypothalamic brain slices and modulate food intake and energy expenditure after acute central administration in vivo. In addition, the effects of NERP-1, NERP-2, PGH-NH2, TLQP-21, TLQP-62, and HHPD-41 on energy homeostasis were studied after chronic central infusion. NERP-1, PGH-NH2, HHPD-41, and TLQP-62 increased the functional activity of hypothalamic neuronal networks. However, none of the peptides altered energy homeostasis after either acute or chronic ICV administration. The present data do not support the potential use of the tested VGF-derived peptides as novel anti-obesity drug candidates."
"10","Effects of fetuin-A with diverse functions and multiple mechanisms on human health.","Fetuin-A (Alfa 2-Heremans-Schmid) is a glycoprotein that is mainly synthesized by hepatocytes and then released into the bloodstream. While fetuin-A, a multifunctional protein, has inhibitory effects on health in the processes of calcification, mineralization, coronary artery calcification (CAC), and kidney stone formation by various mechanisms, it has such stimulatory effects as obesity, diabetes, and tumor progression processes. Fetuin-A produces these effects on the organism mainly by playing a role in the secretion levels of some inflammatory cytokines and exosomes, preventing unwanted calcification, inhibiting the autophosphorylation of tyrosine kinase, suppressing the release of adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), activating the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), triggering the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase/Akt signaling pathway and cell proliferation, and mimicking the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) receptor. In the present review, fetuin-A was examined in a wide perspective from the structure and release of fetuin-A to its effects on health."
"11","Adjusted vs Total Body Weight-Based Dosing of Sedation and Analgesia Used in the Intensive Care Unit.","Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate if dosing fentanyl, dexmedetomidine, and propofol based on ideal or adjusted vs actual weight in patients would decrease overall opioid and sedative use. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review comparing adjusted vs actual weight-based dosing protocol of mechanically ventilated (MV) intensive care unit (ICU) adult patients who required fentanyl and either propofol or dexmedetomidine. Results: A total of 261 patients were included in which 101 patients were in the actual weight group and 160 patients were in the adjusted weight group. Total doses per MV day of fentanyl was 1042 ± 1060 µg in the actual weight group vs 901 ± 1025 µg in the adjusted weight group (P = .13). Total doses per MV day of midazolam was 20 ± 19 mg in the actual group vs 15 ± 19 mg adjusted group (P = .02). Average MV days was 8.2 vs 7.1 days, ICU length of stay was 10.6 vs 9.4 days, and self-extubation rates were 17.8% vs 4.4% in the actual group and adjusted group, respectively. Conclusion: Total midazolam doses per MV day were lower in the adjusted group. No significant change was seen in MV days, ICU length of stay, or self-extubation rates."
"12","Prophylactic Enoxaparin Dosing in Obese Orthopedic Patients: A Literature Search.","Objective: The objective of the study was to review the current literature for prophylactic enoxaparin dosing in obese orthopedic patients. Method: A literature search was undertaken using OVID Medline, OVID Embase, and Cochrane Central databases, accessed through hospital library websites. Key search terms (in UK and US spelling) included orthopaedics, low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, weight, obese, morbid obesity. Possible related subheadings, such as bone, fractures, anticoagulants, overweight, body mass index, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, were also included in the database search to optimize the search strategies. The search was restricted to human subjects and limited to articles published from 1998 to the present. Results: The search identified 429 potentially relevant articles. Once duplicates were removed, 345 were screened for inclusion in this review. Only 3 articles (a case-control study, an observational prospective study, and a case report) met both the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The findings from this review need to be interpreted cautiously due to limitations in study designs and the potential for confounding bias. Conclusion: The results of a multiple database search draw one to the conclusion that there is very limited evidence in the literature with regard to prophylactic enoxaparin dosing in obese orthopedic-specific patients. Orthopedic patients are among the highest risk of all surgical specialties for venous thromboembolism. There is strong evidence to support an increased prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin doses in obese patients; thus, the authors recommend higher prophylactic enoxaparin dosing in obese orthopedic patients."
"13","Immune Competence and Minimizing Susceptibility to COVID-19 and Other Immune System Threats.","Exposure to viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens is unavoidable. Yet, the mere presence of these threats is not enough to automatically predispose to illness. The susceptibility of an individual to viral or bacterial infections is dependent upon immune competence. Many factors can interfere with the functioning of the immune system. Epigenetic alterations in the form of lifestyle or environmental factors can lead to impaired immunity. For example, exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of complications and mortality from COVID-19. Obesity can also exacerbate the damaging effects of air pollution on the lungs and may enhance the association between air pollution and increased COVID-19 severity. Poor sleep is another factor leading to impaired immunity, likely due to the coinciding melatonin depletion. Melatonin has been found to have antiviral and immune-enhancing effects, and it has been proposed that this hormone may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Zinc and vitamins D and C have also been well studied for their ability to shorten the duration of upper respiratory infections, and vitamin D has been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients. Cannabidiol can both directly and indirectly improve immunity by enhancing natural killer cell activity, reducing inflammation, and relieving stress. Other dietary supplements backed by solid scientific evidence to show they act as immune enhancers are astragalus, a yeast fermentate (EpiCor®), olive leaf extract, berberine, N-acetyl cysteine, and garlic."
"14","Сhanges in the functional state of the epithelium of the proximal renal tubules in patients with the initial stage of chronic heart failure during simvastatin therapy.","To assess the change in the functional state of the proximal renal tubule epithelium in patients with dyslipidemia on the background of obesity, by determining the concentration in the urine of the examined level of cystatin C and the degree of activity of the renal organ-specific enzymes neutral α-glucosidase (NAG) and L-alaninaminopeptidase (laap) during simvastatin therapy at a daily dose of 20 mg for 6 months. The study involved 88 people who were divided into three groups: control, comparison and main. The control group is a group of practically healthy individuals: 30 people, average age 20.67 ± 0.18 years, body mass index (BMI) 21.36 ± 0.4 kg/m2. Comparison group (obese): 27 people, average age 22.38 ± 0.76 years, BMI 31.48 ± 0.56 kg / m2. Patients of the main group were divided into 2 subgroups. The first main subgroup of persons with chronic heart failure stage I (CHF I) without type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2)) - 15 observed: average age 56.8 ± 1.8 years, BMI 30.28 ± 1.11 kg / m2. The second main subgroup (CHF I with DM 2) - 16 observed: average age 48.25 ± 2.45 years, BMI 30.37 ± 1.11 kg/m2. The study found that simvastatin therapy does not affect glomerular filtration rate in patients with asymptomatic heart dysfunction. There was an increased level of cystatin C in the urine of the comparison group compared to the control group, the concentration of cystatin C in the main subgroups was statistically significantly higher than the control group. On the background of simvastatin therapy for 6 months, the level of this analyte is statistically significantly increased. The activity of LAAP and NAG during simvastatin therapy during the follow-up period in the CHF I subgroup without DM2 significantly decreased. In the subgroup of CHF I + DM2, a decrease in the concentration of LAAP and an increase in the activity of NAG was revealed, which may indicate that the brush border epithelium dystrophy occurred during simvastatin therapy. Simvastatin therapy for 6 months in patients with the initial stage of heart failure at a daily dosage of 20 mg does not impair glomerular function in the form of reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Cystatin C levels are higher in obese individuals without heart failure and significantly higher in those with asymptomatic heart failure. When treating dyslipidemia with simvastatin at a dose of 20 mg / day, there is a decrease in the activity of NAG and laap in patients with CHF I without DM2. In the result of lipid-lowering therapy with simvastatin in a daily dosage of 20 mg in patients with CHF I+D2M there is increased activity of NAG while reducing the concentration of the LAAP, which may be due to degeneration of the proximal tubular epithelium, amid additional load on a partially renal route of metabolism of simvastatin."
"15","The relationship of the epicardial fat and adipo-fibrokines in myocardial infarction.","Analysis of the relationship between the epicardial fat with adipokine and system ST2/IL-33 in-hospital period, and also with the extent of fibrosis of the atrial myocardium through the year after myocardial infarction in patients with visceral obesity. Examined 88 patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Visceral obesity (VO) is established by computed tomography. In fact the presence VO the patients divided into two groups. Determined the concentration of leptin, adiponectin, stimulating growth factor (ST-2) and interlekin-33 (IL-33) in serum on 1st, 12-day in-hospital period and 1 year after MI. Thickness epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and the percentage of cardiovirus of the myocardium was measured by the method MRI, respectively, on the 12th day of hospitalization and a year after MI. The control group consisted of 30 people. Statistical analysis of data was performed using nonparametric tests. Patients with MI is associated with an increase in the thickness of EAT, imbalance of adipokines with increased leptin, decreased adiponectin in early in-hospital period and development of cardiovirus. Higher values of IL-33 and ЅT2 in the early in-hospital period MI patients with no accompanied by a lower prevalence of cardiovirus in the post-hospital period. The thickness of epicardial fat is directly dependent on the prevalence of myocardial fibrosis, the concentrations of IL-33 and in inverse proportion to the concentration of ЅT2. The degree of cardiovirus is in inverse proportion to the concentration of IL-33 and directly dependent on the concentration of ST2. The increase in EAT closely linked to the development of fibrosis of the atrial myocardium after year. The thickness of EAT more patients MI, which is most pronounced imbalance of adipokines. The metabolic activity of EAT correlated with increased IL-33 and ST2 decrease."
"16","Low levels of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in Andean communities of Ecuador.","The major burden of hypertension (HTN) occurs in low-middle-income countries (LMIC) and it is the main modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Few population studies on HTN prevalence have been carried out in Ecuador where there is limited information regarding its prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of HTN and its association with socio-economic, nutritional, and lifestyle habits in urban and rural Andean communities of Pichincha province in Ecuador. The authors studied 2020 individuals aged 35-70 years (mean age 50.8 years, 72% women), included in the Ecuadorian cohort of the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, from February to December 2018. The hypertension prevalence (&gt;140/90 mmHg) was 27% and was greater in urban than in rural communities, more common in men, in individuals older than 50 years of age, in people with low monthly income and low level of education. Higher prevalence was also observed in subjects with obesity, and among former smokers and those who consumed alcohol. Only 49% of those with HTN were aware of their condition, 40% were using antihypertensive medications, and 19% had their blood pressure under control (&lt;140/90 mmHg). These results showed low levels of awareness, treatment, and control of HTN in the Andean region of Ecuador, suggesting the urgent necessity of implementing programs to improve the diagnosis and management of HTN."

The treatment attribute with greatest importance was mode and frequency of administration (49.1%), followed by nausea risk (30.8%), weight change (11.3%), and HbA1c change (8.8%). Oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg-like profiles were both preferred: the 7 mg-like profile was preferred over dulaglutide (by 91.0% of respondents) and liraglutide (by 89.4%); the 14 mg-like profile was preferred over dulaglutide (by 88.2%) and liraglutide (by 94.4%). Willingness to initiate treatment was also higher for orally administered semaglutide-like profiles: 62.4% with 7 mg and 64.0% with 14 mg, versus 13.6% and 11.0% with injectable GLP-1 RA-like profiles. Subgroup results were generally consistent with the overall sample.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Japanese patients with T2D appear to prefer oral GLP-1 RA profiles over injectable GLP-1 RA profiles, and administration appears to be the most important factor in this decision. This highlights the unmet need for an effective and orally administered GLP-1 RA for the treatment of T2D in Japan. "
"18","Fibroblast growth factor 2 exacerbates inflammation in adipocytes through NLRP3 inflammasome activation.","Chronic inflammation in adipose tissue is the hallmark of obesity and a major risk factor for the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance. NLRP3 inflammasome regulates the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18, and was recently discovered to be involved in obesity-related metabolic diseases. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) such as FGF1, FGF10, and FGF21 are adipokines that regulate adipocyte development and metabolism, but reports on the effect of other FGFs on adipocytes are lacking. In the present study, the novel role of FGF2 in NLRP3 inflammasome activation was elucidated. Our results showed that FGF2 levels were increased during adipocyte differentiation and in the adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Recombinant FGF2 treatment upregulated inflammasome markers such as NLRP3, which was further exaggerated by TNF-ɑ treatment. Interestingly, β-Klotho, a co-receptor of FGF21, was significantly decreased by FGF2 treatment. Results from mice confirmed the positive correlation between FGF2 and NLRP3 expression in epididymal and subcutaneous adipose tissue, while exercise training effectively reversed HFD-induced NLRP3 expression as well as FGF2 levels in both adipose depots. Our results suggest that FGF2 is an adipokine that may exacerbate the inflammatory response in adipocytes through NLRP3 inflammasome activation."

Results were discussed with a sleep specialist and categorized into a 4-level risk probability tool for SDB.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Of 91 adults consenting for overnight oximetry, 90 collected some oximetry data, though 11 of these 90 patients collected technically unsatisfactory oximetry. Thus 79/90 patients (88%) collected adequate oximetry data for at least one night. The oximetry traces suggested likely minimal obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in 41 cases, moderate to severe OSA in 25 patients, severe OSA in 9 patients and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) in 4 cases. Full polysomnography was recommended for 39 patients but only one-third underwent testing. Nineteen patients were reviewed by a sleep specialist. Of the 10 patients who initiated CPAP, four were considered adherent to treatment.

"21","Modelling gestational diabetes mellitus: large animals hold great promise.","Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) characterized by hyperglycemia during pregnancy is a risk factor for various maternal and fetal complications. The key pathophysiological mechanisms underlying its development have not been elucidated, largely due to the lack of a model that accurately simulates the major clinical and pathological features of human GDM. In this review, we discuss the refined criteria for an ideal animal model of GDM, focusing on the key clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of human GDM. We provide a comprehensive overview of different models and currently used species for GDM research. In general, insulin insufficiency consequent to pancreatic β-cell death represents the current leading strategy to mimic human GDM-like hyperglycemia in animals. Nonetheless, these models have a limited capacity to mimic the natural history of GDM, the marked alteration in circulating estrogen/ progestogen, obesity and its related metabolic complications. We discuss emerging evidence of the increased susceptibility to GDM in rodents and large animals with genetic modifications in pregnancy-related hormones. An appraisal of current GDM models suggests that a combination strategy involving dietary stress, pregnancy-related hormones, insulin resistance and metabolic disorders might enable the development of better GDM models and expedite the translation of basic research findings to GDM treatment."

Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A ten-year multi-centred retrospective review of children started on long-term continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure (CPAP, BPAP) in Alberta. Demographic, technology-related, and longitudinal clinical data were collected. Long-term outcomes examined included ongoing NIV use, discontinuation due to improvement in underlying conditions, switch to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death, patient/family therapy declination, transfer of services, and hospital admissions.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":622 children were included. Both younger age and CPAP use predicted higher likelihood for NIV discontinuation due to improvement in underlying conditions (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01). Children with upper airway disorders or bronchopulmonary dysplasia were less likely to continue NIV (p&lt;0.05), while presence of central nervous system disorders had a higher likelihood of hospitalizations (p&lt;0.01). The presence of obesity/metabolic syndrome and early NIV-associated complications predicted higher risk for NIV declination (p&lt;0.05). Children with more co-morbidities or use of additional therapies required more hospitalizations (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01) and the latter also predicted higher risk for being switched to IMV or death (p&lt;0.001).

"26","Musculoskeletal Microbiology: The Utility of the Microbiome in Orthopaedics.","The past 15 years has witnessed a renaissance in the study of the microbes that colonize the human body. The vast majority of the human microbiome resides within the gut. Alterations to the gut microbiome have been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of wide-ranging diseases throughout the body - including atherosclerosis, depression, and obesity. Our understanding of the effects of the gut microbiome on the musculoskeletal system remains in its infancy, but preclinical work has demonstrated an effect of the gut microbiome on the success of orthopaedic surgical procedures, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and muscle mass. In this perspective I review preclinical findings demonstrating that an impaired presurgical gut microbiome can increase the likelihood of developing periprosthetic joint infection and how alterations in the gut microbiome can reduce bone strength by impairing bone tissue material properties. In addition to discussing these examples I review the hypothesis that many chronic non-communicable diseases have become more prevalent in modern industrialized societies as a result of changes in the composition of the gut microbiome resulting from changes in environment/lifestyle (diet, sanitation, antibiotic use). The most burdensome musculoskeletal disorders are chronic and non-communicable and may therefore be related to generational shifts in the composition of the gut microbiome, a possibility I illustrate by reviewing changes in the prevalence of osteoarthritis over the last century. Microbiome based therapeutics are potentially innocuous, inexpensive and have the potential to be effective with only occasional use, making them attractive for addressing the needs of chronic and/or slowly progressing musculoskeletal disorders.

This Phase IIb randomized pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a study protocol for providing financial incentives for dietary self-monitoring and/or weight loss. Community-dwelling adults with obesity were enrolled in a 24 week, group-based weight loss program. Participants were randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial design to receive financial incentives for both dietary self-monitoring and weekly weight loss, just one, or neither. Participants could earn up to $300, evolving from fixed weekly payments to intermittent, variable payments. The notice of reward was provided by text message. The study was conducted in three successive cohorts to evaluate study procedure changes, including dietary approach, recruitment and retention strategies, text messaging, and incentives. Descriptive statistics calculated separately for each cohort described study performance relative to predefined targets for recruitment, including minority representation; retention; adherence; and weight loss. Acceptability was assessed via postintervention qualitative interviews. In Cohort 1 (n = 34), a low-carbohydrate diet was used. Recruitment, retention, adherence, and weight loss were adequate, but minority representation was not. For Cohort 2 (n = 31), employing an additional recruitment method and switching to a reduced-calorie diet yielded adequate recruitment, minority representation, retention, and adherence but less weight loss. Returning to a low-carbohydrate diet in Cohort 3 (n = 28) yielded recruitment, minority representation, retention, adherence, and weight loss similar to Cohort 2. Participant feedback informed changes to text message timing and content and incentive amount. Through successive cohorts, we optimized recruitment and retention strategies and text messaging. An adequately powered trial is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of these incentive structures for reducing weight. The trial registration number is NCT02691260."

While most subjects have 'inert' NAFL, a subset will progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and its life-threatening complications. A substantial body of literature supports that a low muscle mass, low strength, and/or muscle fatty infiltration (myosteatosis) are associated with NAFLD severity. Here, we evaluated the muscle compartment in NASH preclinical models to decipher the kinetics of muscle alterations in relation with liver disease progression.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We developed and validated a micro-computed tomography-based methodology to prospectively study skeletal muscle mass and density in muscle and liver (i.e. reflecting fatty infiltration) in a high-throughput and non-invasive manner in three preclinical NAFLD/NASH rodent models: fat aussie (FOZ) mice fed a high-fat diet (FOZ HF), wild-type (WT) mice fed a high-fat high-fructose diet (WT HFF), and WT mice fed a high-fat diet (WT HF). We compared them with WT mice fed a normal diet (WT ND) used as controls.

Muscle mass or strength was not lower in FOZ HF, WT HF, and WT HFF with early NASH than in controls. Myosteatosis was present in FOZ HF with fibrosing NASH, but also in FOZ HF, WT HF, and WT HFF with early NASH (muscle density = 0.50 ± 0.02, 0.62 ± 0.02, 0.70 ± 0.05, and 0.75 ± 0.03, respectively, with P 60; 0.001 when compared with respective controls). Myosteatosis degree was strongly correlated with NAFLD activity score (r = -0.87, n = 67, P 60; 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the association between myosteatosis and NASH was independent from homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and visceral fat area (P 60; 0.05). Myosteatosis degree powerfully discriminated NASH from benign NAFL and normal liver (area under the receiver operating characteristic = 0.96, n = 67, P 60; 0.001).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Taken together, our data support that there is no sarcopenia in obese mice with early NASH. In contrast, the severity of myosteatosis reflects on hepatocellular damage and inflammation during early NASH development.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a heterogeneous disorder with a complex, poorly understood pathogenesis. To better understand the heterogeneity of TCM, we identified different clinical phenotypes in a large sample of TCM patients by using latent class analysis (LCA).                 Label=""METHODS AND RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, we identified 3139 patients admitted to hospitals in 2016-2017 with a primary diagnosis of TCM. We performed LCA based on several patient demographics and comorbidities: age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, current smoking, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and anxiety and depressive disorders. We then repeated LCA separately with the NIS 2016 and 2017 data sets and performed a robust test to validate our results. We also compared in-hospital outcomes among the different clusters identified by LCA. Four patient clusters were identified. C1 (n = 1228, 39.4%) had the highest prevalence of hyperlipidaemia (93.4%), hypertension (61.6%), and diabetes (34.3%). In C2 (n = 440, 14.0%), all patients had COPD, and many were smokers (45.8%). C3 (n = 376, 11.8%) largely comprised patients with anxiety disorders (98.4%) and depressive disorders (80.1%). C4 (n = 1097, 34.8%) comprised patients with isolated TCM and few comorbidities. Among all clusters, C1 had the lowest in-hospital mortality (1.0%) and the shortest length of stay (3.2 ± 3.1 days), whereas C2 had the highest in-hospital mortality (3.4%).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Using LCA, we identified four clinical phenotypes of TCM. These may reflect different pathophysiological processes in TCM. Our findings may help identify treatment targets and select patients for future clinical trials. "

Goal-directed fluid therapy optimizes cardiac performance and thus tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery. We therefore tested the hypothesis that intra- and postoperative PsqO2 is significantly reduced in obese patients undergoing standard fluid management compared to goal-directed fluid administration.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We randomly assigned 60 obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery to receive either esophageal Doppler-guided goal-directed fluid management or conventional fluid treatment. Our primary outcome parameter was intra- and postoperative PsqO2 measured with a polarographic electrode in the subcutaneous tissue of the upper arm. A random effects linear regression model was used to analyze the effect of intervention.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Overall, mean (± SD) PsqO2 was significantly higher in obese patients receiving goal-directed therapy compared to conventional fluid therapy (65.8 ± 28.0 mmHg vs. 53.7 ± 21.7, respectively; repeated measures design adjusted difference: 13.0 mmHg [95% CI 2.3 to 23.7; p = 0.017]). No effect was seen intraoperatively (69.6 ± 27.9 mmHg vs. 61.4 ± 28.8, difference: 9.7 mmHg [95% CI -3.8 to 23.2; p = 0.160]); however, goal-directed fluid management improved PsqO2 in the early postoperative phase (63.1 ± 27.9 mmHg vs. 48.4 ± 12.5, difference: 14.5 mmHg [95% CI 4.1 to 24.9; p = 0.006]). Intraoperative fluid requirements did not differ between the two groups.

"37","The Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.","                 Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"":The laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become one of the most popular surgical weight loss options. Since its inception as a procedure intended to promote durable weight loss, the association between LSG and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been a point of debate. First and foremost, it is known that GERD occurs more frequently in the obese population. With the sleeve gastrectomy growing to be the predominant primary bariatric operation in the United States, it is imperative that we understand the impact of LSG on GERD.                 Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"":To examine the effects of LSG on GERD symptoms.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":One hundred and ninety-one bariatric surgery candidates completed a Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaire before and after undergoing elective LSG (mean follow-up time of 20.4 ± 2.7 months). Values were stratified by the presence or absence of preoperative GERD, GERD medications, age, gender, crural repair, patient satisfaction with present condition, and percent total weight loss (%TWL).                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":For the entire group, mean weight loss, %TWL, and reduction in BMI were 79 pounds, 28.1%, and 12.7 kg/m2 respectively. Within the overall cohort, there was no significant change in GERD symptoms from before to after surgery (mean GERD-HRQL scores were 6.1 before and after surgery, p = 0.981). However, in a subgroup analysis, patients without GERD preoperatively demonstrated a worsening in mean GERD-HRQL scores after surgery (from 2.4 to 4.5, p = 0.0020). The percentage of change in the usage of medications to treat GERD was not statistically significant (from 37 to 32%, p = 0.233). The percent of patients satisfied with their condition postoperatively was significantly increased in those with preoperative GERD, older age, crural repair intraoperatively, and in those with the highest %TWL.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":These results suggest that while overall LSG does not significantly affect GERD symptoms, patients without GERD preoperatively may be at risk for developing new or worsening GERD symptoms after surgery. It is important to remark that this is a review of the patient's clinical symptoms of GERD, not related to any endoscopic, pathological, or manometry studies. Such studies are necessary to fully establish the effect of LSG on esophageal health. "

Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Data from a cross-sectional study of 880 women from Rufiji, Tanzania, were analyzed. Women's dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. The prime diet quality score (PDQS; 21 food groups; range, 0-42), a unique diet-quality metric for women that captures the healthy and unhealthy aspects of diet, was computed. Generalized estimating equation linear models were used to evaluate the associations of food crop diversity and women's income-earning activities with PDQS, while controlling for socio-economic factors.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Maternal overweight (24.3%) and obesity (13.1%) were high. The median PDQS was 19 (IQR, 17-21). Households produced 2.0 food crops (SD ± 1.0) yearly. Food crop diversity was positively associated with PDQS (P &lt; 0.001), but the association was strengthened by proximity to markets (P for interaction = 0.02). For women living close (&lt;1.1 km) to markets, producing 1 additional food crop was associated with a 0.67 (95% CI, 0.22-1.12) increase in PDQS, versus a 0.40 (95% CI, 0.24-0.57) increase for women living farther away. The PDQS increased with women's salaried employment (estimate, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.26-1.67).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Household food production may interact with access to markets for sales and purchases, while nonfarm income also improves women's diet quality in rural Tanzania.

"42","Community engagement and pediatric obesity: Incorporating social determinants of health into treatment.","Childhood obesity is a complex and multi-faceted problem, with contributors ranging from individual health behaviors to public policy. For clinicians who treat pediatric obesity, environmental factors that impact this condition in a child or family can be difficult to address in a clinical setting. Community-clinic partnerships are one method to address places and policies that influence a person's weight and health; however, such partnerships are typically geared toward community-located health behavior change rather than the deeper social determinants of health (SDH), limiting effective behavioral change. Community-engaged research offers a framework for developing community-clinic partnerships to address SDH germane to obesity treatment. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between SDH and pediatric obesity treatment, use of community-clinic partnerships to address SDH in obesity treatment, and how community engagement can be a framework for creating and harnessing these partnerships. We present examples of programs begun by one pediatric obesity clinic using community-engagement principles to address obesity."

However, it is important to first evaluate how parents respond to this type of information and determine the consequences of educating parents about epigenetics. We have taken an initial step toward this goal by assessing parental responses to an epigenetics learning module. Parents (n = 190, 126 mothers) responded to pre- and post-module survey questions. Prior to the module, parents reported that mothers' lifestyles prior to conception were more important for children's health than fathers' lifestyles prior to conception (t = 4.49, df = 316.5, P &lt; 0.0001). However, after the module, there was no difference between ratings of the importance of mothers' and fathers' preconception lifestyles (t = 1.18, df = 319.8, P = NS). Furthermore, after viewing the module, parents increased their ratings of the importance of both mothers' (t = -5.65, df = 294.8, P &lt; 0.0001) and father's (t = -9.01, df = 287.2, P &lt; 0.0001) preconception lifestyles for child health. After viewing the module, most parents reported feelings of guilt and negativity regarding epigenetics (78 and 55%, respectively). When compared with lean parents, parents with overweight more often reported feelings of guilt (χ2 =10.27, P = 0.001). This work represents an important first step in evaluating parental responses to epigenetics concepts."

The aim of this study was to assess relationships between DTAC and odds of NAFLD in a case-control study. This case-control study was carried out in 158 patients with NAFLD and 357 healthy individuals aged 18-55 years. Dietary data were collected using validated 168-item quantitative food frequency questionnaires. Triacylglycerols (TAGs), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and fasting blood glucose (FBS) concentrations were assessed using enzymatic methods and commercial kits. The DTAC was calculated based on the oxygen radical absorbance capacity of each food reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The mean ± sd (standard deviation) for age and body mass index (BMI) of the study participants were 43⋅9 years ±5⋅9 and had 30⋅5 kg/m2 ±2⋅6. The NAFLD patients included higher BMI and female proportion, compared with the control group. The NAFLD patients included higher smoking rates, biochemical parameters (TG, TC, LDL-C and FBS) and DTAC scores, compared with control groups (P-value &lt; 0⋅05). However, patients with NAFLD had lower HDL levels and physical activities, compared with the control group. The highest tertile of DTAC showed lower odds of NAFLD, compared with the lowest tertile. This association was significant after adjustment for potential confounders (OR, 0⋅19; 95 % CI, 0⋅9-0⋅34; P for trend 0⋅001). Findings suggest that the promotion of naturally increased antioxidant capacities may help prevent odds of NAFLD."
"45","Nutrition, the digestive system and immunity in COVID-19 infection.","The current review aimed to synthesize the literature on the complex relationship between food consumption and nutritional status as well as the digestive system in order to examine the relationship between immunity and potential responses to COVID-19 infection. The goal is to help inform the many healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients. A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. Hand searches were also undertaken using Google and reference lists to identify recent evidence. Studies were critically appraised, and the findings were analyzed by narrative synthesis. Nutritional status can impact immunity in several ways, including affecting susceptibility to infection, severity of disease, and recovery time, and is therefore a significant consideration in the management of COVID-19. COVID-19 can also impact digestive function, which can further impact nutritional status. The role of Vitamin D deficiency in vulnerability to severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, has been recognized, and it may have a role in treatment where deficiency is indicated. Healthcare professionals should be aware that obesity may be accompanied by micronutrient malnutrition including vitamin D deficiency and alterations in the microbiome and inflammatory responses, which can further impact immunity and disease severity. Multidisciplinary team-work is recommended in the management of patients with COVID-19, and approaches should include a consideration of nutritional status (both macronutrients and micronutrients), body weight, and gastrointestinal signs and symptom."

Here, we aimed to evaluate the case fatality rate (CFR) and to identify predictors of mortality in a cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to three hospitals of Northern Italy between March 1 and April 28, 2020. All these patients had a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by molecular methods. During the study period 504/1697 patients died; thus, overall CFR was 29.7%. We looked for predictors of mortality in a subgroup of 486 patients (239 males, 59%; median age 71 years) for whom sufficient clinical data were available at data cut-off. Among the demographic and clinical variables considered, age, a diagnosis of cancer, obesity and current smoking independently predicted mortality. When laboratory data were added to the model in a further subgroup of patients, age, the diagnosis of cancer, and the baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratio were identified as independent predictors of mortality. In conclusion, the CFR of hospitalized patients in Northern Italy during the ascending phase of the COVID-19 pandemic approached 30%. The identification of mortality predictors might contribute to better stratification of individual patient risk."

Forty five adult healthy female rats of 8 weeks old were randomly divided into five equal groups. Different doses of HT 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2% were administered daily to each rats group on the body weight basis for 6 weeks. The results had shown the reduction trend (p &lt; 0.05) in the blood glucose, serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, testosterone, prolactin, ghrelin, total oxidative stress and serum iron levels; while an improvement (p &lt; 0.05) was seen in serum follicle stimulating hormone, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, high density lipoprotein, IgM and total antioxidant capacity. However, no effect (p &gt; 0.05) was noticed in serum IgG, protein, estrogen and calcium levels. A significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) was seen in the apparent nutrient digestibility and body weight gain. The results had shown improvement in the feed conversion ratio (p &lt; 0.05) but non-significant decrease (p &gt; 0.05) in the feed intake. The findings showed that HT had healthy effects on the serum biochemical indices and reproductive hormonal profile but had a negative impact on the nutrient digestibility. Thus, the study concluded that HT could be used as an herbal medicine for the treatment of leading metabolic and infertility diseases like obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome in females."

Studies demonstrated that in case of obesity crucial natural killer (NK) cell functions like combating tumor cells are affected. This study aims to analyze NK cells and NK cell receptor expression of obese mice in a model for postmenopausal breast cancer. Therefore, female BALB/c mice were fed either a high fat or a standard diet. Thereafter, ovaries were ectomized and a syngeneic and orthotopical injection of 4T1-luc2 mouse mammary tumor cells into the mammary adipose tissue pad was performed. Obese mice showed increased body weights and visceral fat mass as well as increased levels of leptin and IL-6 in plasma. Moreover, compared to the lean littermates, tumor growth was increased and the NKp46-expression on circulating NK cells was decreased. Furthermore, the activating NK cell receptor NKG2D ligand (MULT1) expression was enhanced in adipose tissue of obese tumor bearing mice. The present study gives novel insights into gene expression of NK cell receptors in obesity and aims to promote possible links of the obesity-impaired NK cell physiology and the elevated breast cancer risk in obese women."

This study showed very strong statistically significant correlations between low HbA1c and poor sleep quality in patients with T2DM patients, including subjective sleep quality r = 0.763, sleep latency r = 0.327, sleep duration r = 0.472, habitual sleep efficiency r = 0.575, sleep disturbances r = 0.564, use of sleep medication r = 0.728, and daytime dysfunction r = 0.734. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that Vitamin D (mmol/L) (P &lt; 0.001), HbA1c (P &lt; 0.001), duration of DM (P &lt; 0.001), uric acid (mmol/L) (P &lt; 0.001), systolic blood pressure mmHg (P = 0.006), diastolic blood pressure mmHg (P = 0.015), and BMI (P = 0.024) were considered at higher risk as the predictors for sleeping quality among T2DM patients.                 Label=""Conclusion"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":The results suggest a strong positive correlation between PSQI with HbA1c levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, BMI, among type 2 diabetic patients. This study ascertains that poor sleep quality may be due to elevated level of HbA1c, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, and/or hypertension. RésuméObjectif: Le but de cette étude était de déterminer l'impact de la structure du facteur de sommeil du PSQI en tant que prédicteur potentiel de l'HbA1C chez les personnes vivant avec le DT2 dans la communauté turque afin de faciliter son utilisation dans la pratique clinique et la recherche. Méthodes: Il s'agit d'une étude transversale et les participants étaient âgés de 25 à 65 ans et ont visité le service de diabète et d'endocrinologie du Mega Medipol University Teaching Hospital d'Istanbul. Le PSQI a été mené sur 871 patients atteints de DT2. Une bonne qualité de sommeil a été définie comme un score PSQI &lt;5. Une analyse de régression logistique multivariée a été utilisée pour estimer les facteurs de risque associés au T2DM. Résultats: la présente étude a montré des différences significatives entre les hommes et les femmes en ce qui concerne leur âge en années, l'IMC (kg / m2), l'activité physique, le tabagisme, le tabagisme, le revenu, les antécédents familiaux de syndrome métabolique, les maladies coronariennes ( CHD) et PSQI. Les résultats ont révélé des différences significatives entre l'HbA1C≤7 et les femmes et l'HbA1C&gt; 7 patients T2DM en termes de sexe, d'IMC (kg/m2), de maladie coronarienne (CHD) et de PSQI. L'étude a démontré des différences significatives entre les catégories de sommeil PSQI comme bon, moyen et mauvais sommeil chez les patients T2DM en ce qui concerne l'âge et le sexe.. Une analyse de régression logistique par étapes multivariée a révélé que la vitamine D (mmol / L) (P &lt;0,001), l'HbA1c (P &lt;0,001), la durée de la DM (P &lt;0,001), l'acide urique (mmol / L) (P &lt;0,001), la systolique La pression artérielle mmHg (P = 0,006), la pression artérielle diastolique mmHg (P = 0,015) et l'IMC (P = 0,024) étaient considérées comme présentant un risque plus élevé comme prédicteurs de la qualité du sommeil chez les patients atteints de DT2.Conclusion: Les résultats suggèrent une forte corrélation positive entre le PSQI avec les niveaux d'HbA1C, la pression artérielle systolique et diastolique, l'âge, l'IMC, chez les patients diabétiques de type 2. Cette étude établit qu'une mauvaise qualité de sommeil peut être due à un niveau élevé d'HbA1C, au syndrome métabolique, au diabète, à l'obésité et / ou à l'hypertension."
"50","Genetic analysis of obstructive sleep apnoea discovers a strong association with cardiometabolic health.","There is currently limited understanding of the genetic aetiology of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). We aimed at identifying genetic loci associated with OSA risk and to test if OSA and its comorbidities share a common genetic background.We conducted the first large-scale genome-wide association study of OSA using FinnGen Study (217 955 individuals) with 16 761 OSA patients identified using nationwide health registries.We estimated 8.3% [0.06-0.11] heritability and identified five loci associated with OSA (p&lt;5.0×10-8): rs4837016 near GTPase activating protein and VPS9 domains 1 (GAPVD1), rs10928560 near C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), rs185932673 near Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID (CAMK1D) and rs9937053 near Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) - a variant previously associated with body mass index (BMI). In a BMI-adjusted analysis, an association was observed for rs10507084 near Rhabdomyosarcoma 2 associated transcript (RMST)/NEDD1 gamma-tubulin ring complex targeting factor (NEDD1). We found high genetic correlations between OSA and BMI (rg=0.72 [0.62-0.83]) and with comorbidities including hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, depression, hypothyroidism, asthma and inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) (rg&gt;0.30). Polygenic risk score (PRS) for BMI showed 1.98-fold increased OSA risk between the highest and the lowest quintile and Mendelian randomisation supported a causal relationship between BMI and OSA.Our findings support the causal link between obesity and OSA and joint genetic basis between OSA and comorbidities."

The patients in the latter two groups received continuous oxygen via THRIVE during tracheal intubation. All the patients received real-time ultrasound monitoring of the gastric antrum, and positive gastric insufflation (GI+) was defined by the presence of comet-tail artifacts. The cross-sectional area of the gastic antrum (CSA-GA) was measured by ultrasound before and after pre-oxygenation and after intubation. The patients' SpO2, PaO2, and PaCO2 at admission (T1), 5 min after pre-oxygenation (T2), 5 min after medication (T3), and immediately after intubation (T4) were recorded, and the incidence of postoperative adverse events was assessed.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The incidence of gastric insufflation was significantly higher in Group M and Group M+T than in Group T (P &lt; 0.05). The CSA-GA was significantly greater at T4 than at T1 in Group M and Group M+T and in their GI+s ubgroups. The GI+ subgroups in Group M and Group M+ T had significantly larger CSA-GA at T4 than the GI- subgroups (P &lt; 0.05). CSA-GA did not vary significantly during anesthesia induction in Group T (P&gt;0.05). The incidence of grade Ⅰ gastric distension was lower but grade Ⅱ gastric distention was higher in Group M and Group M+T than in Group T (P &lt; 0.05).

The surgical patients were propensity matched 1:10 to nonsurgical patients to assemble a cohort of control patients (n = 330) with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m2 at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing. The primary endpoint was the rate of hospital admission. The exploratory endpoints included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation and dialysis during index hospitalization, and mortality. After propensity score matching, outcomes were compared in univariate and multivariate regression models.

"56","Nrf2: The Master and Captain of Beta Cell Fate.","Prolonged hyperglycemia is toxic to pancreatic β cells, generating excessive reactive oxygen species, defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, decreased insulin production, and eventually β cell death and diabetes. Nrf2 is a master regulator of cellular responses to counteract dangerous levels of oxidative stress. Maintenance of β cell mass depends on Nrf2 to promote the survival, function, and proliferation of β cells. Indeed, Nrf2 activation decreases inflammation, increases insulin sensitivity, reduces body weight, and preserves β cell mass. Therefore, numerous pharmacological activators of Nrf2 are being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of diabetes and diabetic complications. Modulating Nrf2 activity in β cells is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of diabetes."

Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Logistic regressions were used to investigate associations between absolute individual income and adult obesity prevalence in NZ. Linear regressions were used to assess associations between relative income (income inequality measured by Gini) and obesity prevalence (from the NCD-RisC) for OECD countries. Potential impact fractions were calculated to determine how income redistribution might affect obesity prevalence.                 Label=""FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Absolute individual disposable income was significantly associated with obesity in NZ females (but not males) in a shallow, inverted J-shaped fashion. Income inequality was significantly positively associated with obesity prevalence in NZ females but not in males. The Families Package had a modest effect on income distribution and reduced Gini in NZ by 1.43%. Female obesity prevalence in NZ was modelled to decrease by 0.12 percentage points and 0.98 percentage points due to changes to absolute income and income inequality, respectively.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Despite being the most substantial income tax package in New Zealand since the 1990s, this policy had a modest effect on income redistribution, and its expected impact on reducing obesity in females was also modest, with no effect in males. The J-shaped curve indicates that income redistribution could even increase obesity prevalence among low-income women. "

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Participants had a mean body mass index of 32.6 (standard deviation) 4.4 kg/m2, were referred primarily for weight loss and were mostly confident self-rated information technology users. Primary outcome analysis involving those with usable data showed a weak indicative effect in favour of the intervention group (n = 108) compared with the control group (n = 124); 11.8 weekly minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity (95% confidence interval -2.1 to 26.0 minutes; p = 0.10). Sixty-four per cent of intervention participants logged on at least once; they gave generally positive feedback on the web-based support. The intervention had no effect on other physical activity outcomes, exercise referral scheme attendance (78% in the control group vs. 75% in the intervention group) or EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version, or Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores, but did enhance a number of process outcomes (i.e. confidence, importance and competence) compared with the control group at 4 months, but not at 12 months. At 12 months, the intervention group incurred an additional mean cost of £439 (95% confidence interval -£182 to £1060) compared with the control group, but generated more quality-adjusted life-years (mean 0.026, 95% confidence interval 0.013 to 0.040), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of an additional £16,885 per quality-adjusted life-year.

See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information. When health-care professionals refer patients with chronic conditions to an exercise referral scheme, the effects on long-term increases in physical activity are limited. We therefore developed the e-coachER support package to add to usual exercise referral schemes and to prompt the use of skills such as self-monitoring and goal-setting. This package was also intended to empower patients to increase their levels of physical activity long term. The seven-step programme was delivered online (via an interactive website). As part of the package, we mailed participants a guide for accessing the online programme, a pedometer and a fridge magnet with a notepad to record physical activity. We aimed to determine whether or not adding the e-coachER support to usual exercise referral schemes resulted in lasting changes in moderate and vigorous physical activity and whether or not it offers good value for money compared with exercise referral schemes alone. A total of 450 inactive individuals were recruited across Plymouth, Birmingham and Glasgow and were referred to an exercise referral scheme for the following participant-reported main reasons: weight loss (50%), low mood (19%), osteoarthritis (12%), type 2 diabetes (10%) and high blood pressure (8%). Half of the individuals were given access to the e-coachER support and the other half were not. All individuals were mailed a wrist-worn movement sensor (accelerometer) to wear for 1 week and a survey to assess other outcomes at the start of the study as well as at 4 and 12 months post randomisation. At the start of the study, the participants were inactive and most had multiple health conditions. The participants had an average body mass index of 33 kg/m2 and an average age of 50 years. Most (83%) were white. Participants with access to e-coachER support were only slightly more active at 12 months than those who did not have access, but we cannot be confident in the findings because we had data from fewer participants than planned. The lack of a clear effect may have been as a result of around one-third of participants not accessing the website, but otherwise there was reasonable engagement. The provision of the e-coachER support package led to an additional cost of £439 per participant over a 12-month period."

Rather than taking a long break from school during the summer like traditional schools, year-round schools take shorter and more frequent breaks from school. This difference in school calendars allowed for obesogenic behaviors to be collected during three conditions: Condition 1) all children attend school, Condition 2) year-round children attend school while traditional children were on summer vacation, and Condition 3) summer vacation for all children. Changes in BMI z-score were collected for the corresponding school years and summers. Multi-level mixed effects regressions estimated obesogenic behaviors and monthly zBMI changes. It was hypothesized that children would experience unhealthy changes in obesogenic behaviors when entering summer vacation because the absence of the school day (i.e., Condition 1 vs. 2 for traditional school children and 2 vs. 3 for year-round school children).                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":From Condition 1 to 2 traditional school children experienced greater unhealthy changes in daily minutes sedentary (∆ = 24.2, 95CI = 10.2, 38.2), screen time minutes (∆ = 33.7, 95CI = 17.2, 50.3), sleep midpoint time (∆ = 73:43, 95CI = 65:33, 81:53), and sleep efficiency percentage (-∆ = 0.7, 95CI = -1.1, - 0.3) when compared to year-round school children. Alternatively, from Condition 2 to 3 year-round school children experienced greater unhealthy changes in daily minutes sedentary (∆ = 54.5, 95CI = 38.0, 70.9), light physical activity minutes (∆ = - 42.2, 95CI = -56.2, - 28.3) MVPA minutes (∆ = - 11.4, 95CI = -3.7, - 19.1), screen time minutes (∆ = 46.5, 95CI = 30.0, 63.0), and sleep midpoint time (∆ = 95:54, 95CI = 85:26, 106:22) when compared to traditional school children. Monthly zBMI gain accelerated during summer for traditional (∆ = 0.033 95CI = 0.019, 0.047) but not year-round school children (∆ = 0.004, 95CI = -0.014, 0.023).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":This study suggests that the lack of the school day during summer vacation negatively impacts sedentary behaviors, sleep timing, and screen time. Changes in sedentary behaviors, screen time, and sleep midpoint may contribute to accelerated summer BMI gain. Providing structured programming during summer vacation may positively impact these behaviors, and in turn, mitigate accelerated summer BMI gain.

However, teachers find it challenging to implement such programs due to overcrowded curricula. Integrating nutrition with core subjects such as mathematics could potentially address time constraints and improve the learning of both. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the impact of a cross-curricular nutrition and mathematics program on primary school students' portion size estimation skills. Secondary aims include impact on their nutrition knowledge, attitudes towards mathematics and evaluating the quality of the lessons.

These microorganisms have multiple different types of interaction with each other. A plethora of evidence suggests that they can regulate immune and digestive systems and also play roles in various diseases, such as mental, cardiovascular, metabolic and some skin diseases. In addition, they take-part in some current health problems like diabetes mellitus, obesity, cancers and infections. Viral infection is one of the most common and problematic health care issues, particularly in recent years that pandemics like SARS and COVID-19 caused a lot of financial and physical damage to the world. There are plenty of articles investigating the interaction between microbiota and infectious diseases. We focused on stimulatory to suppressive effects of microbiota on viral infections, hoping to find a solution to overcome this current pandemic. Then we reviewed mechanistically the effects of both microbiota and probiotics on most of the viruses. But unlike previous studies which concentrated on intestinal microbiota and infection, our focus is on respiratory system's microbiota and respiratory viral infection, bearing in mind that respiratory system is a proper entry site and residence for viruses, and whereby infection, can lead to asymptomatic, mild, self-limiting, severe or even fatal infection. Finally, we overgeneralize the effects of microbiota on COVID-19 infection. In addition, we reviewed the articles about effects of the microbiota on coronaviruses and suggest some new therapeutic measures."

However, an understanding on the socio-economic inequalities in overweight and obesity of women received little attention, especially in the context of Bangladesh. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure the inequality in overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in Bangladesh as well as to explore the effect of various socio-economic factors on this inequality.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":This study used data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2014 which is a nationally representative data. The concentration index of overweight and obesity was applied to measure the extent of socio-economic inequality. Finally, the concertation index was decomposed in order to understand the contribution of different socio-economic variables in inequality in overweight and obesity of women.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":This study included a total of 16,624 women of reproductive age. The study found that the prevalence of overweight was about 29% and the rate of obesity was approximately 11%. The value of concentration index for overweight and obesity was 0.37 (p &lt; 0.001). This study also observed that about 52% inequality was explained by household's wealth status followed by watching television (25%), husband/partner's educational status (around 7%), women's educational status (about 5%), place of residence (approximately 4%).

Fructose modified adipocyte metabolism compared to glucose, but the regulatory mechanisms and consequences for obesity are unknown. Genome-wide methylation and global transcriptomics in SGBS pre-adipocytes exposed to 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 mM fructose, added to a 5-mM glucose-containing medium, were analyzed at 0, 24, 48, 96, 192, and 384 h following the induction of adipogenesis.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Time-dependent changes in DNA methylation compared to baseline (0 h) occurred during the final maturation of adipocytes, between 192 and 384 h. Larger percentages (0.1% at 192 h, 3.2% at 384 h) of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found in adipocytes differentiated in the glucose-containing control media compared to adipocytes differentiated in fructose-supplemented media (0.0006% for 10 mM, 0.001% for 5 mM, and 0.005% for 2.5 mM at 384 h). A total of 1437 DMRs were identified in 5237 differentially expressed genes at 384 h post-induction in glucose-containing (5 mM) control media. The majority of them inversely correlated with the gene expression, but 666 regions were positively correlated to the gene expression.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Our studies demonstrate that DNA methylation regulates or marks the transformation of morphologically differentiating adipocytes (seen at 192 h), to the more mature and metabolically robust adipocytes (as seen at 384 h) in a genome-wide manner. Lower (2.5 mM) concentrations of fructose have the most robust effects on methylation compared to higher concentrations (5 and 10 mM), suggesting that fructose may be playing a signaling/regulatory role at lower concentrations of fructose and as a substrate at higher concentrations.

"69","Obesity and the Lung: What We Know Today.","Obesity is becoming more and more prevalent especially in Western industrial nations. The understanding of adipose tissue as an endocrine organ as well as the detection of adipocytokines - hormones that are secreted from the adipose tissue - gave reason to examine the interactions between adipose tissue and target organs. These efforts have been intensified especially in the context of bariatric surgery as promising weight loss therapy. Interactions between the lung and adipose tissue have rarely been investigated and are not well understood. There are obvious mechanical effects of obesity on lung function explaining the associations between obesity and lung diseases, in particular obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The rise in the prevalence of obesity affects the epidemiology of pulmonary diseases as well. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on interactions, associations, and consequences of obesity and weight loss on lung function and lung diseases.

"70","A multi-component screen for feeding behaviour and nutritional status in Drosophila to interrogate mammalian appetite-related genes.","                 Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"":More than 300 genetic variants have been robustly associated with measures of human adiposity. Highly penetrant mutations causing human obesity do so largely by disrupting satiety pathways in the brain and increasing food intake. Most of the common obesity-predisposing variants are in, or near, genes that are expressed highly in the brain, but little is known about their function. Exploring the biology of these genes at scale in mammalian systems is challenging. We sought to establish and validate the use of a multicomponent screen for feeding behaviour phenotypes taking advantage of the tractable model organism Drosophila melanogaster.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We validated a screen for feeding behaviour in Drosophila by comparing results after disrupting expression of centrally-expressed genes that influence energy balance in flies to those of ten control genes. We then used this screen to explore the effects of disrupted expression of genes that are either a) implicated in energy homeostasis through human genome wide association studies (GWAS) or b) expressed and nutritionally responsive in specific populations of hypothalamic neurons with a known role in feeding/fasting.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Using data from the validation study to classify responses, we studied 53 Drosophila orthologues of genes implicated by human GWAS in body mass index (BMI) and found that 15 significantly influenced feeding behaviour or energy homeostasis in the Drosophila screen. We then studied 50 Drosophila homologues of 47 murine genes that are reciprocally nutritionally regulated in POMC and AgRP neurons. Seven of these 50 genes were found by our screen to influence feeding behaviour in flies.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Here, we demonstrate the utility of Drosophila as a tractable model organism in a high-throughput genetic screen for food intake phenotypes. This simple and cost-efficient strategy is ideal for high-throughput interrogation of genes implicated in feeding behaviour and obesity in mammals, and will facilitate the process of reaching a functional understanding of obesity pathogenesis.

Cell viability and cytokine production were determined by the MTT assay and ELISA, respectively. RT-PCR was performed to determine iNOS gene expression and the Griess reaction was used to measure nitrite levels. iNOS protein expression, activation of NF-κB and MAPKs, and cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β were determined by Western blot analysis. A carrageenan-induced mouse model of acute inflammation was used in the in vivo experiments.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Pretreatment with WAS concentration-dependently suppressed gene expression and IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL1 and iNOS protein levels in BMDMs stimulated with LPS. In addition, pretreatment with WAS inhibited LPS-induced production of IL-6 and TNF-α in THP-1 cells and CXCL1 in 3T3-L1. Furthermore, LPS induced phosphorylation of p65 in BMDMs, and this induction was dramatically suppressed by WAS pretreatment. We further investigated whether WAS regulates activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is known to be essential for IL-1β processing. WAS inhibited the production of IL-1β, but not IL-6, in response to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and monosodium uric acid (MSU) crystals in LPS-primed BMDMs. Cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β was also reduced by WAS. We finally evaluated the in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of WAS in a mouse model of carrageenan-induced acute inflammation. Subcutaneous administration of WAS reduced production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL1, and IL-1β. Recruitment of immune cells, mostly neutrophils, was also reduced by administration of WAS. Infiltration of inflammatory cells and edema in the submucosa of air pouch tissues were markedly improved in the WAS-treated groups.

Aortic atherosclerosis (AA) is a condition that frequently has been associated with obesity. An obesity paradox, where morbidly obese decedents had either no or minimal AA compared to non-obese decedents, recently has been described by some of us. The explanation for this almost counterintuitive paradox has yet to be determined, but a number of hypotheses were advanced, including hemodynamic factors producing aortic wall shear stress (WSS). The purpose of the present study was to determine if there was a relationship between AA and WSS, as determined by postmortem measurement of aortic wall diameters.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Circumferences of the aorta at the levels of the ascending, thoracic and abdominal aorta were measured in 274 consecutive autopsies over 2 year period of time. AA was assessed using a previously described grading scale as either mild or severe. Circumferences were mathematically converted to diameters and WSS was calculated using the Hagene-Poiseuille formula. Two different methods to estimate cardiac output (CO) were used, both based on literature methods, one of which was BMI dependent, and the other BMI independent. Univariate and multivariable analyses of the relationship between WSS, age, BMI, gender, race and severity of AA were performed.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Of the 274 decedents, 140 had mild and 134 had moderate to severe AA. A BMI&lt;35 was associated with moderate to severe AA. WSS was inversely correlated with AA in all these segments of the aorta in each BMI subgroup with the exception of the ascending aorta for decedents with BMI ≤35 kg/m2. Contrary to what we had hypothesized, WSS was not a determinant of the obesity paradox. However, among all the variables analyzed, a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and age were significant factors for developing AA (RR 0.35, p=0.039; RR 1.51, p=0.0006, RR 1.19, p=0.0001, respectively).

Subjects with the highest tertiles group of LDLc/HDLc had a higher proportion of carotid plaques than the other two groups (47.1% vs. 34.6% and 40.4%, P&lt;0.001). With each unit increase of LDLc/HDLc, the chance of having carotid plaques increased by 65% (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.31-2.08) after adjusted for potential confounders. Among most subgroups, a higher LDLc/HDLc was significantly correlated with the presence of carotid plaques.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Higher LDLc/HDLc was significantly associated with the presence of carotid plaques in the Chinese population with a high risk of stroke. "
"78","Influence of weather conditions on children's school travel mode and physical activity in three diverse regions of Canada.","Children who engage in active school transportation (AST) have higher levels of physical activity (PA). Climate and weather were shown to influence adults' daily travel behaviours, but their influence on children's AST and PA has been less examined. This study examined the influence of weather conditions on children's active school transportation (AST) and overall physical activity (PA). Children in grades 4 to 6 (N=1,699; 10.2 ± 1.0 years old) were recruited in schools located in urban, suburban and rural areas, stratified by area-level socioeconomic status (SES), in three different regions of Canada (Trois-Rivières, Québec; Ottawa, Ontario; Vancouver, British Columbia). Mode of school travel was self-reported and physical activity was measured using a pedometer. We used publicly available data on total precipitation and early morning temperature. AST increased with temperature only among girls. Daily precipitation was negatively associated with boys' and girls' PA while warmer temperature was associated with increased PA on weekend days. We also observed that season and region moderated the relationship between weather conditions and children's physical activity behaviors. Our results suggest that daily weather variations influence children's AST and PA to a greater extent than seasonal variations. Interventions designed to help children and families adapt to weather-related barriers to AST and PA are needed. Novelty bullets • In Canada, weather conditions may influence children's active behaviors daily. • Associations between weather conditions, choice of travel mode and physical activity vary by gender, season, and region. • Weather affects children's PA differently during the week than on weekends."
"79","The levels of sICAM-1, sELAM-1, TNFα and sTNFR1 proteins in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma in tumor and corresponding normal mucosa.","Colorectal cancer is a common malign disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The cancer survival rate depends on the stage of the disease at detection time. It is well known that several molecular mechanisms are involved in cancer and some molecules might affect or modulate cancerogenesis. The aim of the study was to assess the levels of sICAM-1, sELAM-1, TNFα and sTNFR1 protein in tumor and corresponding normal mucosa in a group of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma and also associations of these parameters with demographic and clinical profiles of the patients. Tissue specimens were obtained during resection of neoplastic lesions. Protein levels were assayed in tissue homogenates by ELISA. The protein level of sICAM-1 in tumor was significantly increased in comparison to the corresponding normal mucosa (80.06 ng/mg vs 69.53 ng/mg, p=0.02). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between sICAM-1 and sTNFR1 proteins levels in tumor (rs=0.58, p&lt;0.001) and in corresponding normal mucosa (rs=0.48, p&lt;0.001) was found. Also, significant correlations in corresponding normal mucosa were found between sELAM-1 and sICAM-1 (rs=0.58, p&lt;0.001) and between sTNFR1 and sELAM-1 (rs=0.57, p&lt;0.001). Significantly higher level of sTNFR1 in corresponding normal mucosa samples of patients with distant metastases was observed (p=0.04). Obtained results suggest that sICAM-1 protein could be considered as colorectal cancer marker. Furthermore, sTNFR1 also has the potential to become a good prognostic marker used during monitoring of the patients. Nevertheless, a further study in this area to confirm this correlation is required."
"80","Body Composition Post Pediatric Liver Transplant: Implications and Assessment.","Liver disease has a negative influence on growth and development of children. Measurement of body composition as a component of nutrition status assessment in children before and after transplant would facilitate tailoring of nutrition therapy. A comprehensive literature search on pediatric liver transplant and body composition assessment was performed using a modified systematic approach. This review includes evidence specific to body composition of children undergoing liver transplant and a discussion of relevant body composition assessment methods for this population. Malnutrition is commonly seen in children with liver disease prior to transplant because of the disrupted metabolic pathways from liver dysfunction; however, malnutrition is not consistently diagnosed. Within 1 year of transplant, children tend to quickly recover with weight gain and linear growth. In some children, obesity and sarcopenia have been observed as long-term posttransplant outcomes. Body composition assessment tools have been utilized in diagnosing nutrition status in adults; yet there are limited studies that use these tools in the pediatric liver-transplant population. Technologies available to assess body composition include air displacement plethysmography, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, bioimpedance, and ultrasound. Total body potassium has been used for body composition assessment in adults and children post liver transplant; however, this method is not applicable in a clinical setting. We conclude that understanding posttransplant body composition could help clinicians diagnose and treat malnutrition."

Both groups were counselled about healthy diet and physical activity. For the 3-month intervention period, the IG was trained to use a smartphone app that involved self-monitoring and tailored feedback, as well as a smart band that recorded daily physical activity (Mi Band 2, Xiaomi). Body composition was measured using the InBody 230 bioimpedance device (InBody Co., Ltd), and physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The mHealth intervention produced a greater loss of body weight (-1.97 kg, 95% CI -2.39 to -1.54) relative to standard counselling at 3 months (-1.13 kg, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.69). Comparing groups, the IG achieved a weight loss of 0.84 kg more than the CG at 3 months. The IG showed a decrease in body fat mass (BFM; -1.84 kg, 95% CI -2.48 to -1.20), percentage of body fat (PBF; -1.22%, 95% CI -1.82% to 0.62%), and BMI (-0.77 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.96 to 0.57). No significant changes were observed in any of these parameters in men; among women, there was a significant decrease in BMI in the IG compared with the CG. When subjects were grouped according to baseline BMI, the overweight group experienced a change in BFM of -1.18 kg (95% CI -2.30 to -0.06) and BMI of -0.47 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.80 to -0.13), whereas the obese group only experienced a change in BMI of -0.53 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.86 to -0.19). When the data were analyzed according to physical activity, the moderate-vigorous physical activity group showed significant changes in BFM of -1.03 kg (95% CI -1.74 to -0.33), PBF of -0.76% (95% CI -1.32% to -0.20%), and BMI of -0.5 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.83 to -0.19).

"83","Planifier une grossesse chez une patiente avec un psoriasis.","Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease that starts before the age of 40 years in 3/4 cases. Pregnancy in a couple where one of the future parents has psoriasis is therefore a frequent situation that the dermatologist may encounter and must anticipate. Contraception should be systematically discussed with psoriatic patients of childbearing age, as it is mandatory with certain treatments (as methotrexate or acitretin). Information for psoriatic women planning to become pregnant seems insufficient. Patients get a lot of information on the internet, with the risk of getting wrong information. Women's questions concern the impact of the disease on the fetus, the treatment of flare-ups during pregnancy, the transmission of the disease and the safety of medication during pregnancy. There was a tendency to consider that psoriasis does not affect fertility in men, but two recent studies have shown inflammation of the genital tract in men with psoriasis, with no evidence of an effect on fertility. Regarding the choice of treatment for psoriasis in men with a paternity project, methotrexate should be avoided in the 3 months prior to conception even though the data on many pregnancies occurring on methotrexate are reassuring. Other treatments can be continued. It does not seem that psoriasis affects women's fertility, however, studies are divergent concerning fertility with sometimes a decrease in fertility which would be multifactorial. Psoriasis is associated with many co-morbidities such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, depression, and these co-morbidities can also affect fertility. Genital involvement is common in psoriasis and significantly alters the sexual life of patients. This location is important to investigate and treat. In women with psoriasis, the goal during pregnancy will be to keep the skin disease stable with treatment that is compatible with embryonic and fetal life. The risk-benefit balance should be carefully weighted and discussed with the patient. In a patient who is planning to become pregnant, the treatments to be favored will be according to the severity of the psoriasis: topical steroids, UVB, cyclosporine, anti TNFα, notably certolizumab pegol. In a patient who is planning to become pregnant and has already been treated for psoriasis, consideration should be given to the recommended delay between stopping treatment and conception."

Despite these risk factors, there is a lack of tested preventative interventions for these youths. Given the transient nature of military family deployments, research may be hindered due to difficulty in collecting long-term prospective outcome data, particularly measured height and weight. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of collecting body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) outcome data up to 2 years following a randomized controlled pilot trial of an adapted interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) program aimed at preventing excess weight gain and improving psychological functioning for adolescent military-dependents. In exploratory analyses, patterns in body composition over time were examined.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Twenty-seven adolescent military-dependent girls (baseline: Mage: 14.4 ± 1.6 years; MBMI: 30.7 ± 4.9 kg/m2; MBMI-z: 1.9 ± 0.4) participated in this study. After a baseline assessment, utilizing a computerized program to create a randomization string, girls were assigned to either an IPT or a health education (HE) program. Participants completed three follow-up visits (posttreatment, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up).

Disparities in health conditions among youth in public housing were more common in early adolescence: asthma (26.4 vs 18.6; P &lt; .001); obesity (28.5 vs 24.6; P &lt; .001); depression/anxiety (19.2 vs 17.3; P = .008); behavioral disorders (8.1 vs 5.3; P &lt; .001). These results show that chronic pediatric conditions like asthma and obesity that lead to significant morbidity into adulthood are more common among youth living in public housing. However, this pattern is not consistent across all chronic conditions."
"91","Emerging Role of Adipocyte Dysfunction in Inducing Heart Failure Among Obese Patients With Prediabetes and Known Diabetes Mellitus.","Adipose tissue dysfunction is a predictor for cardiovascular (CV) events and heart failure (HF) in patient population with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and known type 2 diabetes mellitus. Previous preclinical and clinical studies have yielded controversial findings regarding the role of accumulation of adipose tissue various types in CV risk and HF-related clinical outcomes in obese patients. There is evidence for direct impact of infiltration of epicardial adipocytes into the underlying myocardium to induce adverse cardiac remodeling and mediate HF development and atrial fibrillation. Additionally, perivascular adipocytes accumulation is responsible for release of proinflammatory adipocytokines (adiponectin, leptin, resistin), stimulation of oxidative stress, macrophage phenotype switching, and worsening vascular reparation, which all lead to microvascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis acceleration, and finally to increase in CV mortality. However, systemic effects of white and brown adipose tissue can be different, and adipogenesis including browning of adipose tissue and deficiency of anti-inflammatory adipocytokines (visfatin, omentin, zinc-α2-glycoprotein, glypican-4) was frequently associated with adipose triglyceride lipase augmentation, altered glucose homeostasis, resistance to insulin of skeletal muscles, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, lowered survival, and weak function of progenitor endothelial cells, which could significantly influence on HF development, as well as end-organ fibrosis and multiple comorbidities. The exact underlying mechanisms for these effects are not fully understood, while they are essential to help develop improved treatment strategies. The aim of the review is to summarize the evidence showing that adipocyte dysfunction may induce the onset of HF and support advance of HF through different biological mechanisms involving inflammation, pericardial, and perivascular adipose tissue accumulation, adverse and electrical cardiac remodeling, and skeletal muscle dysfunction. The unbalancing effects of natriuretic peptides, neprilysin, and components of renin-angiotensin system, as exacerbating cause of altered adipocytokine signaling on myocardium and vasculature, in obesity patients at high risk of HF are disputed. The profile of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory adipocytokines as promising biomarker for HF risk stratification is discussed in the review."
"92","The Effect of Adverse Patient Characteristics on Perioperative Outcomes in Open and Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.","Objective: To analyze the effect of adverse preoperative patient and tumor characteristics on perioperative outcomes of open (ORP) and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Material and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 656 patients who underwent ORP or RARP according to intraoperative blood loss (BL), operation time (OR time), neurovascular bundle preservation (NVBP) and positive surgical margins (PSM). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for impaired perioperative outcomes. Results: Of all included 619 patients, median age was 66 years. BMI (&lt;25 vs. 25-30 vs. ≥30) had no influence on blood loss. Prostate size &gt;40cc recorded increased BL compared to prostate size ≤ 40cc in patients undergoing ORP (800 vs. 1200 ml, p &lt; 0.001), but not in patients undergoing RARP (300 vs. 300 ml, p = 0.2). Similarly, longer OR time was observed for ORP in prostates &gt;40cc, but not for RARP. Overweight (BMI 25-30) and obese ORP patients (BMI ≥30) showed longer OR time compared to normal weight (BMI &lt;25). Only obese patients, who underwent RARP showed longer OR time compared to normal weight. NVBP was less frequent in obese patients, who underwent ORP, relative to normal weight (25.8% vs. 14.0%, p &lt; 0.01). BMI did not affect NVPB at RARP. No differences in PSM were recorded according to prostate volume or BMI in ORP or RARP. In multivariable analyses, patient characteristics such as prostate volume and BMI was an independent predictor for prolonged OR time. Moreover, tumor characteristics (stage and grade) predicted worse perioperative outcome. Conclusion: Patients with larger prostates and obese patients undergoing ORP are at risk of higher BL, OR time or non-nervesparing procedure. Conversely, in patients undergoing RARP only obesity is associated with increased OR time. Patients with larger prostates or increased BMI might benefit most from RARP compared to ORP."
"93","Randomized Controlled Lifestyle Intervention (LION) Study for Weight Loss and Maintenance in Adults With Obesity-Design and Methods.","Introduction: Due to the increasing prevalence of obesity, approaches for a more effective treatment especially in the long-term perspective are needed. However, studies on weight loss and maintenance show heterogeneous results with large inter-individual variations. Therefore, it is of interest to identify factors that contribute to inter-individual differences and predict the success of long-term weight management. Methods and Analysis: The primary outcome of the Lifestyle Intervention (LION) Study is to evaluate the effect of two diets (low carb vs. low fat) and two digital counseling tools (newsletter vs. mobile application) on weight maintenance 12 months after weight loss. The identification of predictive factors (e.g., genetic, epigenetic, physiological, psychological) for the success of weight loss and maintenance is a secondary outcome. Men and women with a body mass index (BMI) between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m2, aged 18-65 years, and without severe diseases are considered eligible. After phenotyping (e.g., anthropometry, resting metabolic rate, meal challenges, blood parameters) participants will follow a formula-based, low-calorie diet (LCD) for 8 weeks. In addition, the intake of 200 g raw or cooked non-starchy vegetables are allowed per day. Subsequently, 252 participants will be randomized into one of the four intervention groups (low carb/app, low carb/newsletter, low fat/app, low fat/newsletter) for the 12-month weight maintenance step. The study will be concluded after another 12 months of follow-up. Results should provide indications for successful weight management and give insights into the personalized treatment of obesity. Ethics and Dissemination: This study has been granted ethical approval by the local Ethics Review Committee of the School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich (vote: 69/19 S). Trial Registration Number: This study has been registered within ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04023942) and the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00017819)."
"94","Early Gut Fungal and Bacterial Microbiota and Childhood Growth.","Introduction: Childhood growth is a sensitive marker of health. Animal studies show increased height and weight velocity in the presence of fungal as well as antibiotic supplement in feed. Human studies on early gut microbiota and anthropometrics have mainly focused on bacteria only and overweight, with diverging results. We thus aimed to investigate the associations between childhood growth [height and body mass index (BMI)] and early fungal and bacterial gut microbiota. Methods: In a population-based cohort, a subset of 278 pregnant mothers was randomized to drink milk with or without probiotic bacteria during and after pregnancy. We obtained fecal samples in offspring at four time points between 0 and 2 years and anthropometric measurements 0 and 9 years. By quantitative PCR and 16S/ITS rRNA gene sequencing, children's gut microbiota abundance and diversity were analyzed against height standard deviation score (SDS) and BMI-SDS and presented as effect estimate (β) of linear mixed models. Results: From 278 included children (149 girls), 1,015 fecal samples were collected. Maternal probiotic administration did not affect childhood growth, and the groups were pooled. Fungal abundance at 2 years was positively associated with height-SDS at 2-9 years (β = 0.11 height-SDS; 95% CI, 0.00, 0.22) but not with BMI-SDS. Also, higher fungal abundance at 1 year was associated with a lower BMI-SDS at 0-1 year (β = -0.09 BMI-SDS; 95% CI, -0.18, -0.00), and both bacterial abundance and bacterial alpha diversity at 1 year were associated with lower BMI-SDS at 0-1 year (β = -0.13 BMI-SDS; 95% CI, -0.22, -0.04; and β = -0.19 BMI-SDS; 95% CI, -0.39, -0.00, respectively). Conclusions: In this prospective cohort following 0-9-year-old children, we observed that higher gut fungal abundances at 2 years were associated with taller children between 2 and 9 years. Also, higher gut fungal and bacterial abundances and higher gut bacterial diversity at 1 year were associated with lower BMI in the first year of life. The results may indicate interactions between early gut fungal microbiota and the human growth-regulating physiology, previously not reported.

"95","Different analysis strategies of 16S rRNA gene data from rodent studies generate contrasting views of gut bacterial communities associated with diet, health and obesity.","                 Label=""Background"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":One of the main functions of diet is to nurture the gut microbiota and this relationship affects the health of the host. However, different analysis strategies can generate different views on the relative abundance of each microbial taxon, which can affect our conclusions about the significance of diet to gut health in lean and obese subjects. Here we explored the impact of using different analysis strategies to study the gut microbiota in a context of diet, health and obesity.                 Label=""Methods"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Over 15 million 16S rRNA gene sequences from published studies involving dietary interventions in obese laboratory rodents were analyzed. Three strategies were used to assign the 16S sequences to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on the GreenGenes reference OTU sequence files clustered at 97% and 99% similarity.                 Label=""Results"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Different strategies to select OTUs influenced the relative abundance of all bacterial taxa, but the magnitude of this phenomenon showed a strong study effect. Different taxa showed up to 20% difference in relative abundance within the same study, depending on the analysis strategy. Very few OTUs were shared among the samples. ANOSIM test on unweighted UniFrac distances showed that study, sequencing technique, animal model, and dietary treatment (in that order) were the most important factors explaining the differences in bacterial communities. Except for obesity status, the contribution of diet and other factors to explain the variability in bacterial communities was lower when using weighted UniFrac distances. Predicted functional profile and high-level phenotypes of the microbiota showed that each study was associated with unique features and patterns.                 Label=""Conclusions"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":The results confirm previous findings showing a strong study effect on gut microbial composition and raise concerns about the impact of analysis strategies on the membership and composition of the gut microbiota. This study may be helpful to guide future research aiming to investigate the relationship between diet, health, and the gut microbiota. "
"96","Foraging efficiency, social status and body condition in group-living horses and ponies.","Individual animals experience different costs and benefits associated with group living, which may impact on their foraging efficiency in ways not yet well specified. This study investigated associations between social dominance, body condition and interruptions to foraging behaviour in a cross-sectional study of 116 domestic horses and ponies, kept in 20 discrete herds. Social dominance was measured for each individual alongside observations of winter foraging behaviour. During bouts of foraging, the duration, frequency and category (vigilance, movement, social displacements given and received, scratching and startle responses) of interruptions were recorded, with total interruption time taken as a proxy measure of foraging efficiency. Total foraging time was not influenced by body condition or social dominance. Body condition was associated with social dominance, but more strongly associated with foraging efficiency. Specifically, lower body condition was associated with greater vigilance. This demonstrates that factors other than social dominance can result in stable differences in winter body condition."
"97","Five genes influenced by obesity may contribute to the development of thyroid cancer through the regulation of insulin levels.","Previous studies indicate that obesity is an important contributor to the proceeding of thyroid cancer (TC) with limited knowledge of the underlying mechanism. Here, we hypothesize that molecules affected by obesity may play roles in the development of TC. To test the hypothesis above, we first conducted a large-scale literature-based data mining to identify genes influenced by obesity and genes related to TC. Then, a mega-analysis was conducted to study the expression changes of the obesity-specific genes in the case of TC, using 16 independent TC array-expression datasets (783 TC cases and 439 healthy controls). After that, pathway analysis was performed to explore the functional profile of the selected target genes and their potential connections with TC. We identified 1,036 genes associated with TC and 534 regulated by obesity, demonstrating a significant overlap (N = 176, p-value = 4.07e-112). Five out of the 358 obesity-specific genes, FABP4, CFD, GHR, TNFRSF11B, and LTF, presented significantly decreased expression in TC patients (LFC&lt;-1.44; and p-value &lt; 1e-7). Multiple literature-based pathways were identified where obesity could promote the pathologic development of TC through the regulation of these five genes and INS levels. The five obesity genes uncovered could be novel genes that play roles in the etiology of TC through the modulation of INS levels."

Median (IQR) adiponectin was 4516.82 (2799.32-7065.85) ng/mL. After adjusting for potential confounders including BMI, higher adiponectin levels were associated with increased odds of PH (adjusted odds ratio per log increment in adiponectin, (1.81; 95% CI, 1.41-2.32). High adiponectin levels were also associated with associated HF admissions (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per log increment in adiponectin, 1.63, 95% CI, 1.24-2.14) and mortality (adjusted HR per log increment in adiponectin, 1.20; 95% CI 1.02-1.41).                 Label=""Conclusions"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Elevated plasma adiponectin levels are associated with PH, HF admissions and mortality risk in AAs. High adiponectin levels may help identify an at-risk population that could be evaluated for targeted prevention and management strategies in future studies. "
